An outbreak of jaundice in Mandoora village in Tral hamlet of south Kashmir's Pulwama district has raised concerns as 8 children have tested positive.

A health official informed the news agency -- Kashmir News Observer (KNO) -- that the screening process is underway, and so far, 8 children have been tested positive in the area.

He said that medical teams along with Asha have been carrying out a door-to-door awareness campaign to educate people how to keep themselves safe. They have been guiding them to use boiled water and use vegetables and fruits after washing them properly.

Residents said that contaminated water may be the reason, and there is a need to check it out.

A health official said that 8 cases of jaundice have been reported from the village, and the situation is under control.

He said that 7 among eight are recovering while one was tested positive just a day before, and advised the locals to use boiled water only and take care of [personal] hygiene as well.

Meanwhile, an official said that samples of the water being supplied to the locals have already been taken, while the report is yet to come.

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative recently reported that the Republic of Pakistan has confirmed 3 cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) infections in the Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces.

As of the end of 2024, the total number of WPV1 cases in Pakistan has reached 67. Furthermore, 52 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported last week, which indicates that additional polio cases will be confirmed in 2025.

The South Asian nation of around 240 million people has been declared as one of 2 countries (Afghanistan) where polio is endemic.

As VOA reported last year [2024], a representative of Pakistan's Ministry of Health stated that polio eradication is the country's top priority. ""Despite the recent resurgence, a unified plan aims to stop polio transmission by 2025.""

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), countries affected by poliovirus circulation are subject to temporary recommendations issued by the Emergency Committee of the International Health Regulations on Poliovirus.

The WHO and the US CDC recommend that all travelers to 36 polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents and visitors of infected regions who have been there for more than 4 weeks should receive an additional oral or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

Globally, the type 2 novel oral polio (nOPV2) vaccine has been administered over 1 billion times in the past few years. In the United States, the IPV is offered at travel clinics and pharmacies in 2025.

Separately, the US Department of State says, ""Reconsider travel to Pakistan as some areas have increased civil unrest risk.""

Measles cluster linked to central Taiwan hospital reaches 16 cases
------------------------------------------------------------------
A cluster of confirmed measles cases connected to a hospital in central Taiwan has reached 16, according to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

Speaking at a routine press conference on Tuesday [7 Jan 2025], CDC spokesperson Tseng Shu-hui confirmed there were 2 new cases related to the hospital cluster, with the 1st case in the cluster an overseas-imported index case reported on 10 Dec 2024.

The spokesperson said the CDC has traced 3123 contacts linked to the cluster, the highest number of contacts traced for any measles cluster over the past 5 years.

In addition to the 2 new cases connected to the hospital cluster, the CDC also reported 2 further cases from patients who flew into Taiwan from Vietnam and India.

There have been 33 measles cases in Taiwan so far this year [2025], according to the CDC, with 21 contracted domestically and 12 imported from abroad.

Internationally, measles cases in some countries have increased significantly over the past 6 months, the CDC said.

In Vietnam, for instance, there were more than 6700 confirmed cases in 2024 -- a more than 100-fold increase compared with 2023, the agency said.

Measles is ""not very common"" in Taiwan nowadays because most people are vaccinated with the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to information published on the CDC's website.

Hundreds of hepatitis A infections will be tied to blueberries in Albert Heijn recall
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Several hundred people could have already become infected with the hepatitis A virus [HAV] as a result of contaminated frozen blueberries sold by Albert Heijn, a spokesperson for Dutch public health institute RIVM confirmed to NL Times. Already 12 people have been diagnosed with the infection dating back to November [2024], including 2 people who were hospitalized with serious symptoms. The infected patients range from 25 to 77 years of age, the RIVM informed media outlet NOS. The contaminated blueberries, sold in 1 kg [2.2 lb] bags under the supermarket's house brand, were available in stores until Monday [13 Jan 2025]. The affected products have a ""best before"" date of 14 Apr 2026 [2025? - Mod.JH]. They can be returned to any Albert Heijn shop for a full refund.

The RIVM expects to learn of more infections as it can take 2 weeks for symptoms to develop in an infected person, the RIVM spokesperson said. ""It does not mean every case will be serious,"" he said. Anyone experiencing symptoms of hepatitis A, such as fatigue, nausea, jaundice, or abdominal pain, should contact their doctor, the store noted in its recall. Symptoms are often mild, but the infectious disease can cause liver inflammation in adults, particularly those with weakened immune systems.

The virus ""probably got into the blueberries during the harvest,"" another RIVM representative told Nu.nl. ""It's possible that an infected berry picker didn't wash his or her hands properly after visiting the toilet."" The virus can be passed from humans through contact with the feces of an infected person. ""With poor hygiene, there is a chance that an infected person will transmit the virus to the berries."" Washing the berries is unlikely to help, as the virus can firmly remain on the fruit.

The first reported hepatitis A case tied to the outbreak occurred in late November [2024], according to public health service GGD. Subsequent cases led the RIVM to launch an investigation. The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) tested the blueberries and confirmed the presence of hepatitis A. The contaminated blueberries originated from a Polish manufacturer, and the RIVM emphasized that poor hygiene during the food production process was likely the cause of the outbreak. Albert Heijn clarified that the issue is limited to the 1 kg [2.2 lb] frozen bags. Other products, such as frozen blueberries in paper boxes or mixed red fruit bags, are sourced from a different supplier and are not affected.

While hepatitis A outbreaks of this scale are not unprecedented, the RIVM noted they occur roughly once per year in the Netherlands. The organization has launched a broader investigation to determine the extent of the current outbreak.

Despite these obstacles, collaborative efforts involving governments, international organizations, and community leaders are crucial for achieving a polio-free Nigeria and a healthier future.",All Africa.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202501030154.html,"Date: Fri 3 Jan 2025
Source: All Africa.com [edited]
<https://allafrica.com/stories/202501030154.html>


The most populous country in Africa, Nigeria, was once the epicenter of wild polio; in 2012, it accounted for almost all cases of polio worldwide. Many factors contribute to this, including the density of the population, poor sanitation, and the lack of access to health care.

The World Health Organization (WHO) describes poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio, as a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects children under 5, leading to irreversible paralysis and, in severe cases, death.

Nigeria has made significant strides toward eradication, but regions like Sokoto State, located on the northwest side of Nigeria, face unique challenges due to insecurity and conflict, which hinder vaccination campaigns and threaten progress.

Aishat Hashim, a registered nurse, midwife, and public health specialist from Sokoto State, said that having worked on polio eradication projects for over 15 years, she believes eradication is possible but will require a collective effort and addressing the root causes of the challenges related to insecurity and climate change before eradication can be achieved.

""While the country has made significant progress in reducing polio cases, there are still challenges to overcome, particularly in the northern region, including Sokoto State. The World Health Organization and other partners are working closely with the government on vaccination efforts and improved surveillance,"" said Hashim.

Several international organizations have been instrumental in combating polio in Sokoto State, Nigeria, through collaborations with the Nigerian government, local health authorities, and community leaders to ensure the success of polio eradication efforts. These include UNICEF, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the WHO, which have contributed billions of dollars to immunization campaigns, disease surveillance, and public health infrastructure.

Despite all these efforts, Sokoto is battling the circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), caused by gaps in immunization coverage and other public health challenges.

Negative effects of conflict in polio eradication efforts
--------------------------------------------------
Insecurity poses a significant challenge to polio eradication in Sokoto State by limiting access, disrupting services, and increasing mistrust. Armed banditry and the displacement of communities due to insecurity make it difficult for health workers to reach populations, monitor their patients, and deliver lifesaving vaccines to children. However, through community engagement, innovative delivery methods, and coordinated security efforts, progress can still be made in safeguarding children against the poliovirus.

""Polio has had a devastating effect on individuals and communities in hard-to-reach and affected areas, as many children have already been paralyzed or disabled, and families have been torn apart by polio. The economic burden of polio is also significant because many families struggle to access healthcare and rehabilitation services,"" said Hashim.

Vaccination campaigns
-----------------------
""Vaccination campaigns play a crucial role in preventing polio, especially the OPV oral polio vaccine, which is the most commonly used vaccine in Nigeria, and has been effective in reducing polio cases,"" she said. ""However, in areas with low vaccination coverage, the risk of derived poliovirus is increasing, and new cases are emerging.""

Hashim said that there are some challenges in delivering vaccines, such as insecurity, poor infrastructure, and misinformation.

Militia groups such as Boko Haram and communal conflict have led to instability, making certain areas inaccessible to health workers. This insecurity hampers the consistent delivery of vaccines to all children, leaving pockets of unvaccinated populations vulnerable to polio outbreaks.

Hashim said health workers like herself navigate security risks by working closely with local authorities and community leaders.

""We also use innovative strategies like outreach services and mobile vaccination teams to reach these vulnerable populations and ensure coverage,"" she said.

Remote and hard-to-reach communities, coupled with inadequate infrastructure, also pose significant challenges in transporting vaccines, maintaining cold-chain systems, and ensuring timely immunization.

""Misinformation and vaccine hesitancy are significant challenges; some communities are skeptical about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, which makes them hesitant to take it, leading to low vaccine coverage,"" said Hashim.

She stressed the importance of community and religious leaders in dispelling misinformation.

""Community leaders help promote vaccine acceptance, remove misconceptions, and address any hesitancy about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. They also mobilize communities for vaccination campaigns, ensuring community involvement and providing support to health workers,"" she said.

While Nigeria remains wild polio-free, other countries in Africa are still seeing resurging cases. Mozambique reported a resurgence of wild poliovirus in 2022, marking the first detection in the country since 1992. The outbreak occurred in Tete Province, with cases linked to the neighboring Malawi outbreak. This resurgence has brought renewed urgency to immunization campaigns and public health interventions. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Somalia have also reported new polio cases, raising public health concerns amid ongoing challenges like insecurity.

Climate change
---------------
Cyclones, floods, and other natural disasters frequently disrupt health services, including immunization campaigns.

Nigeria faces significant climate challenges, including rising temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, desertification, and increased frequency of floods and droughts. These environmental changes affect access to healthcare, the spread of diseases, and the sustainability of vaccination programs critical to polio eradication.

Like Nigeria, Mozambique, a low-income country in Southern Africa, is one of the most climate-vulnerable nations in the world.

The country faces frequent and intense climate-related disasters, including cyclones, floods, and droughts. Mozambique also faces insecurity in the northern part of the country, which further hinders effective vaccination administration.

These challenges exacerbate existing social and economic vulnerabilities, creating significant hurdles for public health, food security, and sustainable development.

Displaced populations in disaster-affected areas are at increased risk of missing routine vaccinations. In 2019, the country was hit by cyclones Idai and Kenneth, causing widespread destruction. These events displaced millions, destroyed infrastructure, and disrupted essential services such as healthcare, education, and electricity supply.

""Eradicating polio in Nigeria requires a sustained and collective effort. We must continue to support vaccination efforts, promote community engagement and involvement throughout the campaign, and address the root causes of insecurity and misinformation, because together we can achieve a polio-free Nigeria and a safer, healthier world for all,"" said Hashim.

The vulnerability of Africa to climate change underscores the urgent need for comprehensive adaptation and mitigation strategies. There is a need for governments, international organizations, and local communities to work together to address the impacts of extreme weather events, water scarcity, and public health challenges.

Investments in climate resilience and effective public health systems can help Africa reduce the devastating effects of climate change, alleviate disease burdens, and build a sustainable future for its population.

80% of those infected with viral hepatitis in Jijel are school children
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The health directorate of [the State of] Jijel sounded the alarm regarding the spread and expansion of the scope of viral hepatitis across the state, especially during the past year, 2024, as the number of confirmed cases of this disease reached, according to these services, [a total of] 180 cases, an increase of more than 20 cases over the previous year. 

If the hepatitis A virus is not new in the state of Jijel, which has a long history with this dangerous disease, in which contaminated water is the main cause of infection, the most dangerous thing revealed by the state's health services is that most of those infected with this disease across the state's territory during 2024 are school children, or rather, from the age group between 5 and 19 years, which is the group that represents students in the 3 educational levels (primary, middle and secondary).

The same services confirmed that the percentage of those infected with the aforementioned disease from this group among the total number of those infected across the state during the year 2024, which ended a few days ago, reached 80%, which is something that calls for a moment of reflection and scrutiny, according to these services. This is although the latter asserted at the same time that the infections recorded among these children, or rather school children, do not mean that the educational institutions in which these children study are the source of this disease or that the water provided to those infected in these institutions was the cause of this, but rather there are other reasons behind the high number of infections among this group, which must be investigated and diagnosed in order to prevent the registration of more infections among this category in the future and then limiting the scope of the disease, which has become a real source of concern for the health departments in Jijel. 

The municipalities of Taher, Cheqfa, El Milia, Ziama Mansouria, in addition to the capital of the state, Jijel, occupied the top spot on the list of municipalities of the state that recorded the largest number of cases of viral hepatitis during 2024, according to reports from the services of the state's health directorate, which called on everyone to mobilize in order to reduce the number of infections with this disease and avoid the worst in the future, especially among children.

Possible hepatitis A exposure at Rio Grande in Boulder, CO
----------------------------------------------------
There was a possible hepatitis A exposure at the Rio Grande Mexican Restaurant in Boulder, Colorado, according to the Boulder County Public Health (BCPH). That facility is located at 1101 Walnut Street in Boulder. The possible exposures took place on 30 Dec 2024 and 5 Jan 2025.

Health department officials have found that there is no ongoing risk to the public because the restaurant acted quickly to ensure the safety of staff and patrons. But anyone who drank one or more of these beverages on those dates may have been exposed to the virus:

- Plain fresh squeezed OJ
- Mimosa with fresh squeezed OJ
- Michelada with fresh lime juice
- Mimosarita with fresh squeezed OJ
- Big Tex margarita with fresh lemon and lime juice
- Barrel-Aged Big Tex margarita with fresh lemon and lime juice
- Special reserve coin margarita with fresh lime juice
- Silver coin margarita with fresh lime juice
- Fresh jalape√±o margarita with fresh lime juice
- Skinny margarita with fresh lime juice
- Kendall's skinny margarita with fresh lime juice
- Agave martini with fresh lemon and lime juice
- Mezcal margarita with lemon and lime juice

It's too late for anyone who consumed those beverages in December [2024] to get a vaccination against hepatitis A. But check with your doctor to make sure. Monitor your health for the symptoms of hepatitis A for the next 50 days and see your doctor if you get sick.

Anyone who drank those items afterward [until 6 Jan 2025] have until 19 Jan 2025 to get a vaccine. Contact your doctor, or visit a local pharmacy, which may have the vaccine available.

BCPH will be providing vaccinations at no cost for anyone who is not up to date on hepatitis A vaccine and who consumed potentially contaminated beverages. No appointments are necessary. Clinics will be held in the Sundquist building, located at 3482 Broadway in Boulder, on
- Thu 16 Jan from 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.; and
- Fri 17 Jan from 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.

Any beverages that were consumed at that restaurant on other days, or that did not contain freshly squeezed juice, are not considered a risk.

Symptoms of hepatitis A usually begin 15 to 50 days after infection. That means that people are infectious for 2 weeks before they even know they are sick. Symptoms include fatigue, sudden nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain, especially in the upper right quadrant. Other symptoms may be clay-colored stools, dark urine, a low-grade fever, loss of appetite, joint pain, diarrhea, and intense itching. The characteristic symptom of hepatitis A is yellowing of the skin and eyes, known as jaundice.

Hepatitis A is a contagious liver infection caused by the virus. While most people usually recover completely from this infection, some, especially those with liver disease, can become seriously ill. The best way to prevent spread of this virus is by getting vaccinated.

Abstract
--------
Background
The risk of blood-borne infections, particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), continues to persist in developing countries among patients who receive blood products, such as hemophiliacs, but there is a lack of up-to-date data in such countries. This study aims to determine the prevalence of HBV and HCV infections among a group of hemophilia patients in [Sulaymaniyah], Kurdistan Region, Iraq.

Methods
This prospective cross-sectional study, conducted from June to September 2022, screened 117 hemophilic patients in the region for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV antibodies using serologic assays.

Results
One hundred fifteen participants were male (98.3%) with a mean age of 20.7 years (8-47). HBV seropositivity was found in 9 (7.7%) patients, while HCV seropositivity was noted in 15 (12.8%). No significant correlation was observed between HBV/HCV infectivity status and age, residency, or education status (p<0.05). The prevalence of only HBV was significantly higher among patients with more frequent clotting factor intake (p=0.016), which was associated with lower odds of HBV positivity (OR=0.034, 95% CI: 0.002‚Äì0.492). Moreover, HCV seropositive patients were more commonly associated with surgical history compared to negative cases (20% vs. 3.9%; p=0.044), which was associated with significantly increased odds of HCV positivity (OR=6.125, 95% CI: 1.221‚Äì30.719).

Conclusion
This study reveals an intermediate prevalence of HBV (7.7%) and a high prevalence of HCV (12.8%) infections among hemophilia patients in the Kurdistan Region, Iraq.

Measles outbreak in Bizkaia with 12 confirmed cases
-----------------------------------------------
The Health Department of the Basque Government has reported the existence of a measles outbreak in Bizkaia, with 12 confirmed cases, originating from an imported case. The Department of Health has confirmed that all affected people are progressing favorably, and health authorities maintain active the surveillance protocol established to detect, investigate, characterize, and control all isolated cases and outbreaks of measles.

People who may have had contact with any of the cases confirmed by Public Health have been informed of the situation; it is recommended that they limit social activities for 21 days, use a well-fitting mask, and actively monitor the appearance of compatible symptoms such as fever, cough, rash, conjunctivitis, or nasal congestion. Given the appearance of symptoms, people identified as contacts have been instructed to remain at home until the transmission period ends to stop the spread of the infection.

Euskadi has a high vaccination coverage, being 96.79% for the first dose and 92.44% for the second dose in the year 2023, which contributes to reducing the risk of spread of the virus. However, Health has stressed the importance of keeping vaccination up to date, both in children and in the adult population, to prevent the spread of the virus.

Along these lines, he has said that it is ""especially relevant to review and update the vaccination situation of those people who have not received any dose or have received only one dose, a situation that may be more common in people born in the 1970s and the '80s, as well as in people from countries or regions with vaccination schedules different from that of the Basque Country or with vaccination coverage lower than those in our environment.""

Number of pertussis (whooping cough) cases soars in 2024 and reaches the highest level in 9 years in the country
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2024, Brazil recorded the highest number of pertussis cases in the last 9 years, according to data from the Ministry of Health. Notifications of the disease increased by 2702% compared to 2023, with 5998 confirmed cases, compared to just 214 in 2023. Data from the Ministry of Health panel indicate that ParanÃ¡, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais led the percentage increases in pertussis cases between 2023 and 2024. In ParanÃ¡, for example, the number of reported cases increased from 16 in 2023, to 2423 in 2024, representing exponential growth.

In 2024, Brazil again recorded deaths from pertussis, totaling 27 deaths. The last record of death from the disease occurred in 2020, when only one fatal case was reported. Most deaths occurred in babies under one year of age, an age group in which whooping cough is considered particularly serious.

The Health Departments of ParanÃ¡ and Santa Catarina assess that the growth in the number of cases may be related to the cyclical nature of the bacteria's circulation. They also mention as a hypothesis for this surge in cases the resumption of social interactions after the COVID-19 pandemic combined with lower vaccination coverage.

In a note, the Ministry of Health adds that the increase is related to the strengthening of surveillance and diagnosis in the country, which includes the incorporation of the PCR test into the SUS and greater access to detection tests in the private network. The data also show that the majority of registered cases occur in white people, living in urban areas and under one year of age. Experts point out that this profile may be related [to access - Mod.RNA] to the greater number of exams and diagnoses carried out for this group.

The Ministry of Health added, in a note, that to protect against whooping cough, until 5 Jan 2025 [in a period starting when?
- Mod.RNA], more than 6.6 million doses of the pentavalent vaccine, 3.93 million doses of DTP and 2.4 million of dTpa were administered. The Health Departments of ParanÃ¡, Santa Catarina, Rio de Janeiro, and SÃ£o Paulo pointed out, in responses sent to Folha, that they carry out several actions against the spread of the disease, such as training health professionals and alerting the population to the need for immunization, especially pregnant women and people who have direct contact with babies. Minas Gerais did not respond until the publication of this report.

Respiratory failure due to measles complications
--------------------------------------------------
Mr. [T], 34 years old, contracted measles from his daughter without knowing it and bought medicine to take himself, leading to serious complications and respiratory failure.

Mr. [T]'s daughter had contracted measles and was treated at the hospital for 7 days. After that, Mr. [T] had a high fever for 3 days but thought ""adults don't get measles,"" so he bought medicine to take himself. His condition was serious -- he couldn't eat or drink, and a blood test at home showed that his platelets were low -- so he went to the hospital for examination.

On 20 Jan [2025], Dr. Le Xuan Luat, Department of Internal Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, said that Mr. [T] had bilateral lung damage along with diarrhea, a history of acute hepatitis, and elevated liver enzymes. Two days after being admitted to the hospital, the patient's entire body had a red rash that spread from the face to the feet. His eyes were red and swollen, and his vision was blurred due to conjunctivitis and keratitis. Measles complications caused the patient to have respiratory failure, requiring oxygen.

Doctor Luat said that measles has no specific treatment like flu; the treatment regimen is to reduce symptoms and improve health. Respiratory doctors use high doses of antibiotics to treat pneumonia, in conjunction with ophthalmology to treat eye injuries with specific drugs.

After 10 days of treatment, the lung damage decreased, the rash gradually disappeared, [Mr. T] could breathe on his own, the eye damage decreased, and liver enzymes decreased. He was discharged from the hospital, continued to take medication, and was monitored.

Doctor Luat said that at the Department of Internal Medicine, Tam Anh General Hospital, Hanoi, measles in adults is recorded at 5 cases per week, most of which are accompanied by complications. Many cases have complications of pneumonia, respiratory failure, conjunctivitis or digestive disorders, and increased liver enzymes requiring intensive care. Many patients cannot determine whether they have been vaccinated against measles or not; their immunity to measles may have declined over time or they have underlying diseases, chemotherapy, cancer ...

Measles is a contagious disease caused by a virus, transmitted through the respiratory tract by sneezing and close contact with an infected person. According to the Department of Preventive Medicine, Ministry of Health, since the beginning of the year [2024], the country has recorded more than 38 000 suspected measles cases, an increase of more than 94 times compared to 2023. The number of positive measles cases is more than 6700, an increase of more than 130 times compared to 2023.

Doctor Luat said that measles patients who are subjective and do not seek medical examination and timely treatment can die. People without a clear vaccination history should get a measles booster shot. When there are signs of cough and fever, patients need to go to the doctor to determine the cause and receive appropriate treatment. Prevent the disease by wearing a mask, isolating the patient, washing hands regularly, cleaning the living space, and limiting going to crowded places.

Spain faces largest increase in hepatitis A in a decade: 894 cases in 2024
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Spain is facing a worrying situation: 894 confirmed cases of hepatitis A mark the largest increase in cases in a decade. This unexpected viral outbreak raises questions about current public health measures. In recent months, there has been a significant increase in the number of cases of hepatitis A in various regions. Official records indicate that the highest figures are in Andalusia, Madrid, and Catalonia, which is causing concern among health authorities. This increase in incidence indicates a possible accelerated spread of the virus in these areas.

This scenario directly affects the affected communities, where public health is compromised. Below are the regions with the highest number of reported cases:
- Andalusia: 166 cases
- Madrid: 161 cases
- Catalonia: 114 cases
- Balearic Islands: high infection rate
- Basque Country and Canary Islands: significant increase

The high rate of infection in these areas underlines the need to strengthen preventive and control measures.

In response to the increase in hepatitis A cases, various actions have been put in place to contain the spread of the virus. One of the main initiatives is the implementation of free vaccination campaigns focused especially on risk groups. People with chronic diseases, health workers, and those in close contact with infected people receive priority in these programs, seeking to increase herd immunity.

In addition, health authorities are promoting awareness, raising efforts through the media and education. Practices that contribute to prevention are encouraged, such as frequent handwashing and food hygiene. These measures aim not only to reduce the number of current infections, but also to prevent future outbreaks and protect public health in the long term.

Detecting hepatitis A outbreaks early presents challenges because the virus has an incubation period that can extend up to a month. The asymptomatic nature of many infections further complicates epidemiological surveillance. Responding in a timely manner requires a well-coordinated and proactive public health system capable of accurate monitoring and rapid responses.

The hepatitis A virus is spread primarily by fecal-oral transmission, highlighting the need to maintain high standards of personal and collective hygiene . In places such as schools and restaurants, where the spread may be easier, it is essential to implement strict hygiene policies. To prevent the transmission of the virus, collaboration between health authorities and these establishments is essential, promoting safe and effective practices.

In a press communique to Le360, the director of epidemiology and disease control, MOH Morocco, revealed that the country is witnessing what could be an outbreak of measles by recording 25 000 cases of measles in the period September 2023 to January 2025, while the annual cases before that used not to exceed 4 to 5 cases per annum. He noted that the current spread of measles is unusual. He attributed this rise to the lowering of measles vaccine coverage in the previous years due to the rising anti-vaccine campaigns and other factors in comparison to more than 95% measles vaccination coverage rate in the past.

Sancti Sp√≠ritus registers an uptick in hepatitis A cases not seen in the last decade
---------------------------------------------
Sancti Sp√≠ritus closed 2024 with an alarming rebound in hepatitis A cases, reaching a total of 1080 diagnoses, a figure that was not reported in the province in the last decade, according to statements by Yurien Negr√≠n Calvo, deputy director of the Provincial Center for Hygiene, Epidemiology and Microbiology, to the official newspaper Escambray.

The official explained that at the beginning of 2025, the cases persist. The initial outbreak registered in the municipality of La Sierpe has spread, also affecting Sancti Sp√≠ritus and Cabaigu√°n, although with less intensity. Given this panorama, the authorities of the Ministry of Public Health (MINSAP) have intensified control and prevention actions, emphasizing self-care and personal hygiene.

""Hepatitis A is an acute viral disease transmitted by contamination of water and food, with an oral-fecal route of infection. It is essential to reinforce the quality of water and food hygiene to protect ourselves and avoid further infections,"" said Negr√≠n Calvo.

One of the biggest challenges facing the province is the lack of adequate means to diagnose the disease. According to Negr√≠n Calvo, most cases are detected clinically and do not have laboratory confirmation due to the shortage of essential reagents. This, in addition to limiting the accuracy of the diagnosis, generates underreporting of the disease, since many patients do not seek medical services.

""At this time, the diagnosis is clinical and epidemiological, supported by basic tests such as aminotransferases, but we do not have the necessary coverage to perform specific examinations. In addition, an undetermined number of patients remain outside the health system, which aggravates under-registration,"" he admitted.

The lack of resources not only affects the detection of the aforementioned condition, but also of other widespread diseases in the country such as dengue and Oropouche fever, which are usually diagnosed solely based on symptoms, without certified tests.

The deterioration of the plumbing infrastructure and cross contamination are some of the key factors driving the increase in diseases in Cuba. Negr√≠n Calvo highlighted the leaks, siphoning, and lack of continuous water supply as serious problems in Sancti Sp√≠ritus. The situation is not exclusive to this province. In May 2024, Cienfuegos reported an outbreak of hepatitis A in the Reina popular council, attributed to contamination of drinking water with wastewater. Two months earlier, Ciego de √Åvila experienced an 86% increase in acute diarrheal diseases compared to the previous year, also linked to low water quality.

Authorities recommend boiling water before drinking it, washing fruits and vegetables, and disinfecting surfaces with chlorine, especially in homes with sick people. In addition, they insist on frequent hand hygiene and the separation of personal utensils in case of contagion. However, these measures are insufficient in the face of a root problem: the collapse of the public services system and the lack of political will to solve it. Meanwhile, citizens continue to face outbreaks of preventable diseases, reflecting a health system that cannot guarantee even the most basic things in terms of prevention and diagnosis.

RI reports 1st confirmed measles case since 2013. What you should know
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A case of measles has been confirmed in Rhode Island for the first time since 2013, the state Department of Health announced Saturday [18 Jan 2025]. The patient was a young, unvaccinated child with a recent history of international travel who was hospitalized at Hasbro Children's Hospital earlier this month [January 2025], the health department said in a news release. The child is now at home and is well, the release said. Health officials said the child did not have any school or day-care contacts, so the risk to the public is considered to be low. Contact tracing is now underway with a limited number of patients and families who are believed to have had contact with the child during the infectious period.

The health department said the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine offers the best protection against measles. Approximately 97% of Rhode Island kindergarteners have completed the MMR series, the news release said.

""Measles is almost entirely preventable through vaccination,"" said Director of Health Jerry Larkin. ""Any parent or guardian who has a child at home who is older than a year old and has not been vaccinated against measles should talk to their child's health-care professional."" Families who do not have insurance or have trouble accessing care can obtain the vaccine for free through the Department of Health, Larkin added.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus that spreads easily when an infected person coughs or sneezes or through close personal contact. Symptoms, which typically appear 7 to 14 days after exposure, typically include
- high fever,
- cough,
- runny nose,
- red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis),
- tiny white spots inside the mouth on the inner lining of the cheek, and
- a rash made up of large, flat blotches.

The 2 people who were exposed are being monitored and advised to quarantine as much as possible and wear a mask in public places. According to the Snohomish County Health Department, a person infected with measles traveled through the airport on 10 Jan [2025].

""If a person was at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on 10 Jan between 2:30 p.m. and 8 p.m., it is possible that they were exposed to measles. The infected person was in the S-Gate concourse, the D-Gate concourse, customs arrivals, and baggage claim,"" the department wrote in a release Tuesday [21 Jan 2025].

Health officials say people who were exposed at that time would likely start seeing symptoms between 17 and 31 Jan 2025. Snohomish County has not yet said if these 2 new cases were connected to the exposure at the airport.

Measles spreads through the air and is highly contagious, according to the Snohomish County Health Department. Measles has a characteristic rash; it is red and flat, and it first appears on the face. According to the Center for Disease Control, other initial symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes. Tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth 2 to 3 days after those symptoms begin and before the distinct rash forms.

""Measles is highly contagious and, in severe cases, can cause very high fevers, pneumonia, and, although more rare, brain swelling, and even death,"" says Dr. James Lewis, health officer for Snohomish County. ""As of this past December, measles was reported in 30 states, including Washington, and 80% of those cases were in people who did not have confirmed vaccination.""

Groups who are most likely to experience severe symptoms include children under age 5, pregnant people, and people with weakened immune systems or underlying chronic conditions, according to the Snohomish County Health Department.

Juneau city officials warn residents of potential measles exposure at SEA-TAC airport
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The city and borough of Juneau is warning of a potential measles exposure at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The case was reported earlier this month [January 2025] and could impact Southeast Alaska residents.

According to an alert shared on Friday [17 Jan 2025], an unvaccinated adult experiencing symptoms of the viral infection was traveling through the airport on 10 Jan [2025]. The infected person flew from Seattle to Anchorage during the afternoon and evening around the same time multiple flights were leaving for Southeast Alaska. The person is a Kenai Peninsula resident and was heading home after traveling overseas. They received hospital care in Homer.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that can spread through the air or by direct contact, according to the CDC. It can be especially dangerous for young children and undervaccinated communities.

The Alaska Department of Health confirmed the case last week. State Epidemiologist Joe McLaughlin said in an interview that the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine can significantly lower the risk of contracting the virus.

""The measles component of that vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines on the planet. It's about 97% effective at preventing measles,"" McLaughlin said.

The vaccination rate for kindergarteners in Southeast Alaska was roughly 65% last year [2024]. That's significantly lower than the national average, which is 93%. Both the state and national averages have been dropping since the pandemic.

McLaughlin encourages people who traveled during the same timeframe as the infected individual to reach out to their health-care provider by phone if they begin experiencing symptoms. Those can include a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes, sore throat, and a rash. He said the state hasn't confirmed any other Alaska cases yet, but noted that the incubation period can last up to 21 days after initial exposure.

""We still have a little ways to wait to see if we're going to see any secondary transmission or secondary cases as a result of exposure to this person who was infected,"" he said.

The WHO declared measles had been eliminated in the US in 2000, but the CDC warned in 2024 that a recent spike in cases threatened to reverse that status. In Alaska, measles outbreaks are relatively rare. This is the first confirmed case in the state since 2019.

RI reports 1st confirmed measles case since 2013. What you should know
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A case of measles has been confirmed in Rhode Island for the first time since 2013, the state Department of Health announced Saturday [18 Jan 2025]. The patient was a young, unvaccinated child with a recent history of international travel who was hospitalized at Hasbro Children's Hospital earlier this month [January 2025], the health department said in a news release. The child is now at home and is well, the release said. Health officials said the child did not have any school or day-care contacts, so the risk to the public is considered to be low. Contact tracing is now underway with a limited number of patients and families who are believed to have had contact with the child during the infectious period.

The health department said the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine offers the best protection against measles. Approximately 97% of Rhode Island kindergarteners have completed the MMR series, the news release said.

""Measles is almost entirely preventable through vaccination,"" said Director of Health Jerry Larkin. ""Any parent or guardian who has a child at home who is older than a year old and has not been vaccinated against measles should talk to their child's health-care professional."" Families who do not have insurance or have trouble accessing care can obtain the vaccine for free through the Department of Health, Larkin added.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus that spreads easily when an infected person coughs or sneezes or through close personal contact. Symptoms, which typically appear 7 to 14 days after exposure, typically include
- high fever,
- cough,
- runny nose,
- red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis),
- tiny white spots inside the mouth on the inner lining of the cheek, and
- a rash made up of large, flat blotches.

This discovery prompted responses in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, including reporting through international health regulations and early warning systems. Genetic analysis revealed that the European strains were linked to a cVDPV2 strain first identified in Nigeria. The genetic diversity suggests the virus may have been introduced to Europe from an unknown source.  Additionally, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners have updated the Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan (GPSAP) for 2025-2026, focusing on eradicating wild poliovirus type 1 and stopping the transmission of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2.",,https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.3.2500037,"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was founded in 1988 (1 [for complete references, see source URL. - Mod.LL]), great progress has been made towards a poliovirus-free world. Nevertheless, the risk of international spread still exists due to the continued emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) outbreaks and the continued circulation of wild-type 1 poliovirus in areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Therefore, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) was announced in 2014 and is still in place (2).

Since September 2024, circulating VDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) has been detected in wastewater samples within routine and research environmental surveillance (ES) activities in 5 European countries: Finland, Germany, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom (UK). Here we describe the surveillance, detection and characterization of cVDPV2.

Environmental surveillance for poliovirus in 5 European countries
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To survey the circulation of polioviruses, countries are responsible of maintaining appropriate surveillance systems. As a supplementary system to clinical diagnosis, wastewater-based poliovirus surveillance offers the opportunity to detect the reintroduction or circulation of polioviruses in the population at an early stage and to take appropriate measures to minimize their spread.

Environmental surveillance for poliovirus is conducted within the framework of routine programmes (Finland, Poland, UK) or research projects (Germany, Spain) to support the GPEI. The reporting laboratories are accredited by the WHO Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) and represent either national (Poland, Spain), regional (Finland, Germany) or global (UK) specialized reference laboratories for poliovirus surveillance. Analysis workflows are based on WHO recommendations (3) and include virus isolation by cell culture and/or molecular methods (PCR, sequencing); protocols are published or available upon request. Details of the methods used in the different laboratories and dates of the first cVDPV2 detections in wastewater are shown in Table [for tables/figures, see source URL. - Mod.LL].

All countries responded to the poliovirus detections following WHO recommendations (4). All detections were reported via International Health Regulations (IHR; <https://www.who.int/>) and Early Warning and Response System (EWRS; <https://ewrs.ecdc.europa.eu/>) so that a quick response including risk assessment could be carried out. Timely collaboration organised by the WHO Regional Office for Europe (WHO/Europe) involving the WHO headquarters, the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) enabled quick data exchange and analysis of sequencing results.

Handling of wastewater samples for poliovirus testing
-----------------------------------------------------
All activities involving wastewater were conducted in separate laboratory areas to avoid simultaneous processing of clinical samples and wastewater samples. All laboratories work under appropriate biocontainment requirements.

Cell culture isolation and molecular characterisation of polioviruses
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Two different cell lines were used: a transgenic mouse cell line, highly specific to poliovirus infection due to carrying the human poliovirus receptor (L20B) and a human cell line (RD-A), very sensitive for infection by polio and non-polio enteroviruses (NPEV), providing the best combination to increase the chance for poliovirus detection. Detection of cytopathic effect (CPE) on RD-A cells, expected from most wastewater samples due to the ubiquitous presence of NPEV, also serves as a control to confirm that processing of wastewater samples was correct. Virus isolation on L20B cells either directly or through cross passaging between RD-A and L20B cells allows isolation of poliovirus. Cultures of L20B with CPE are selected for further molecular characterization by intratypic differentiation (ITD) (CDC, catalogue number GR-139) and/or by amplification of the virus protein 1 (VP1) region and/or the near whole genome region by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR followed by Sanger or Oxford nanopore technology (ONT) sequencing.

Direct detection of polio and non-polio enteroviruses
-----------------------------------------------------
Direct detection of enteroviruses from concentrated wastewater samples was either performed by partial or full VP1 amplification followed by ONT sequencing using published protocols.

Nucleotide sequence analysis
----------------------------
Sequencing data were processed and analysed using Geneious Prime version 2020.0.3 (<https://www.geneious.com/>), Sequencher 5.4.6 (<https://www.genecodes.com/>) and MEGA X (<https://www.megasoftware.net/>). The VP1 sequences (903‚ÄØnt) generated from PCR products from virus isolates or directly from wastewater concentrates were aligned and compared with the sequence of the Sabin 2 vaccine reference strain (GenBank [<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/>] identification code [ID]: AY184220). The VP1 phylogenetic relationships between all cVDPV2 isolates were inferred using the maximum likelihood method and Tamura-Nei model within Geneious Prime version 2020.0.3 software and the phylogenetic tree was visualised using Microreact software. Whole genome sequences from virus isolates generated by ONT sequencing were analyzed by alignment to the Sabin 2 vaccine reference sequence to identify possible recombination events revealed by differences in the degree of sequence identity to the vaccine strain across the genome.

Detection of cVDPV2
-------------------
Results of poliovirus detections from wastewater samples from the 5 countries involved are shown in Figure 1. Besides NPEV strains, sporadic detections of oral polio vaccine (OPV) strains (Sabin-like [SL]) type 1 and 3 and VDPV strains type 3 (VDPV3) were identified during the period reported, proving the high sensitivity of the system. Since the OPV is not used in the countries reporting here, these virus strains are most probably shed by individuals traveling from countries using bivalent OPV (types 1 and 3) in their vaccination schedule. Circulating VDPV2 strains were detected in 5 countries with different frequency, with the virus found in Finland in only 1 sample and in Spain and Poland in only 2 samples. In Germany, cVDPV2 strains were detected in wastewater samples in all sites sampled, and in some sites, the virus was found for 4 continuous weeks. In the UK, cVDPV2 strains were found in various sites but at a lower frequency than in Germany. These differences in cVDPV2 detections suggest different levels of infection in the 5 countries but might also reveal differences in the sensitivity for poliovirus detection from the different wastewater sites.

Genetic characterization of cVDPV2 strains
------------------------------------------
All cVDPV2 strains were genetically related to each other and showed 43-52 VP1 nt differences from the Sabin 2 vaccine reference strain. Initial analysis conducted at CDC identified all European cVDPV2 strains as genetically linked to cVDPV2 emergence NIE-ZAS-1, first detected in June 2020 in Zamfara, Nigeria, and actively circulating in various African countries in recent years. Classification of cVDPV2 met the GPEI requirements for VDPV classification and reporting (<https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Reporting-and-Classification-of-VDPVs_Aug2016_EN.pdf>). The European cVDPV2 strains form a separate cluster within NIE-ZAS-1 branching pattern and showed 13 VP1 nt differences from the parent cluster suggesting at least 1‚ÄØyear of undetected circulation leading to these detection events, likely occurring outside of the catchment areas of these European ES sites, as otherwise viruses would have been detected earlier.

As shown in Figure 2, VP1 sequence analysis revealed high sequence diversity between isolates from the same site or country but relatively high sequence identity between isolates from different countries, e.g. the 2 isolates from Poland are closer to other European isolates than they are between themselves; 5 of 6 isolates from the UK are closer to other European strains than they are to other UK isolates; and some isolates from Germany are closer to other European strains than they are to other German isolates. This observed genetic diversity argues for nearly simultaneous importations of genetically related viruses having occurred into different European locations from an unknown country or area during a short period of time although other explanations are possible, such as some transmission occurring between European countries.

Whole genome sequence analysis of cVDPV2 strains
------------------------------------------------
Whole genome sequence analysis of selected European NIE-ZAS-1 isolates (n = 16) revealed a double recombinant structure with viruses having replaced sequences upstream and downstream the capsid coding region with those from unidentified enterovirus C strains (Figure 3). Given the extent of transmission of NIE-ZAS-1 cVDPV2 since 2020, this is not unexpected as polioviruses are known to frequently recombine with enterovirus C strains during their evolution in humans. Consequently, the European cVDPV2 NIE-ZAS-1 strains are expected to have lost the attenuation properties of Sabin 2 and increased their potential to cause paralytical disease by replacing the 5' non-coding region where the main attenuation mutation locates and, in addition, mutating at the secondary attenuation site in residue 143 of the VP1 capsid protein.

Discussion
----------
The GPEI is based on 3 pillars: vaccination, surveillance and containment. Besides clinical systems like acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance, enterovirus or laboratory-based surveillance systems, testing of wastewater samples, if done systematically, may detect silent circulation of polioviruses before symptomatic cases occur. The detection of cVDPV2 in 5 European countries described here highlights the usefulness of wastewater surveillance for poliovirus, particularly in polio-free countries using inactivated polio vaccine. Due to a low manifestation index and the possibility to be transmitted in vaccinated populations, polioviruses can circulate over a long period of time undetected and pose a risk for individuals who are not sufficiently protected by antibodies. Routine wastewater testing for poliovirus can inform public health authorities early so that adequate measures can be introduced in time. The affected countries included in this report have alerted national public health authorities about the results, undertaken public health risk assessments and put the information into the public domain. Key to the risk assessment is a review of national, regional and local vaccination coverage data to identify communities with low vaccination coverage for targeted vaccination campaigns. It is unclear whether NIE-ZAS-1 cVDPV2 might have also been imported into other European countries. While some countries might be missing such events due to lack or limited wastewater surveillance, ES is conducted in at least 23 of the 53 countries within the WHO European Region so more detections might occur in the near future.

Conclusions
-----------
The simultaneous detection of genetically related cVDPV2 strains in different sites in Europe further justifies keeping the PHEIC active, the importance of fully investigating any suspect AFP case and the necessity to continue conducting sensitive ES for poliovirus and increasing vaccination coverage to prevent symptomatic poliomyelitis cases.

An unvaccinated metro Atlanta resident contracted measles, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH), and the agency is working to identify any persons that may have been exposed through contact with the individual between January 19 and 24 [2025], when they were infectious.

The individual acquired the virus while traveling within the United States. This is the first reported measles case in Georgia in 2025; last year [2024], DPH reported 6 cases of measles.

The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is safe and effective at preventing measles and rubella, according to the CDC.

If young people do not receive their immunizations on time, we could see cases of measles and even whooping cough reemerge, said Dr. Christy Peterson with Atrium Health Navicent in Macon in 2021 after a noticeable drop in childhood vaccinations. The time to vaccinate children is before we see them get sick, she said. ""We don't see these [potentially] devastating, terrible diseases anymore because the vaccines are so effective,"" she said. ""And so people get relaxed and they forget. They just think, 'It's fine; I'll let everybody else get vaccinated.'""

DPH epidemiologist Dr. Cherie Drenzek said the cause of a 2019 outbreak was an unvaccinated family whose measles cases were not reported to the state. Five previously unreported cases of measles were discovered in one Cobb County family that October. Health officials identified 50 people who were possibly exposed during the 2019 outbreak and susceptible to infection. Many were infants too young to vaccinate, but others were older. ""They may have been adults who were unvaccinated or kids that were unvaccinated, that weren't infants or they were immunocompromised individuals,"" Drenzek said.

In Georgia, about 90.7% of children receive an MMR vaccination before 35 months of age, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Georgia had 18 cases of measles in 2019, more than double the number the state had seen over the previous decade.

Children receive their first dose of MMR vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age and a second dose between 4 and 6 years old. More than 95% of the people who receive a single dose of MMR will develop immunity to all 3 viruses, DPH said in its news release. A second dose boosts immunity, typically enhancing protection to 98%.

People with symptoms of measles should contact their health care provider immediately but not visit the doctor's office, the hospital, or a public health clinic without first calling to let them know about your symptoms, the agency said. Health care providers who suspect measles in a patient should notify public health immediately.

Measles has returned to Texas, with 2 cases confirmed in Houston last week. No cases have been found in Central Texas, but measles is a worry for health officials, causing Austin Public Health and the Texas Department of State Health Services to issue alerts.

""Vaccination is our best defense against measles and other preventable diseases,"" said Austin-Travis County Health Authority Dr. Desmar Walkes. ""By staying up to date on vaccinations, we not only protect ourselves but also the most vulnerable members of our community.""

Why the concern?
Measles is highly contagious and it is airborne. If one person with measles walks into a room, 90% of people who are unvaccinated or do not have natural immunity will become infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Measles can survive for up to 2 hours in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed. If another person breaths the contaminated air or touches an infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses or mouths, they can become infected.

Measles also comes with days or weeks of illness, horrible side effects and lifelong complications or death. ""We've seen those cases after measles or chicken pox with complications in the brain and body,"" said Dr. Edgar Navarro Garza, a pediatrician at Harbor Health. ""Their quality of life will never be the same.""

Why is measles back?
Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, but then one big thing changed. People decided not to vaccinate their children with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. One dose of the MMR vaccine is typically given at 12 to 15 months and then a second at 4 to 6 years.

Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are required by kindergarten to enroll in public schools unless you get an exception.

There have been 5 confirmed cases of whooping cough (pertussis) in Putnam County, the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health (BPH) said Thursday [23 Jan 2025]. According to the agency, those cases have been documented since Friday, January 17 [2025].

""The BPH has been working closely with the local health department to monitor the situation and ensure appropriate measures are taken,"" the agency reported. It went on to say, ""a notification has also been sent to impacted residents regarding potential exposure.""

The BPH said West Virginia had not seen a rise in cases that has been noticed nationwide since last summer [2024]. Health officials said they will keep Gov. Patrick Morrisey informed about any new developments.

[Original report from 22 Jan 2025]

WSAZ has confirmed an internal memo being shared on social media platforms was sent to Marshall Health Network staff. According to the memo, there have been 3 confirmed cases reported at Hurricane High School in Putnam County, as well as additional cases in Cabell County and Lawrence County, Ohio. According to Putnam County Health Department officials, 1 confirmed case has been reported within the county.

Hurricane High School sent parents a text advising them to visit Schoology or the HHS Facebook page for information regarding recent cases of whooping cough in their community. WSAZ is also attempting to reach out to health officials in Lawrence County, Ohio, for more information. Officials with the Cabell-Huntington Health Department said it's too early to tell how many whooping cough cases there are in their coverage area. Early symptoms may resemble the common cold. It may take weeks, even months, for the cough to go away.

WSAZ reached out to a spokesperson with Marshall Health Network, but they would not confirm where the memo originated. The spokesperson referred us to a medical doctor with Marshall Health Network who tells WSAZ at least 2 or more cases of whooping cough that might seem related constitutes an outbreak. ""Recently we have observed an increase in pertussis cases in our community,"" according to a Marshall Health Network release.

Also known as pertussis, whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory disease. It spreads through respiratory droplets and primarily affects unvaccinated people and those with weakened immune systems. Health officials say unvaccinated people are at an increased risk of severe disease and that pregnant women in the third trimester are among the most vulnerable.

<https://doh.sd.gov/news/south-dakota-department-of-health-reports-pertussis-death/>


The Department of Health is reporting the death of a child due to a co-infection of pertussis and influenza. The last pertussis death occurred in 2023 among a pediatric patient.

South Dakota is currently experiencing pertussis cases in multiple communities and influenza activity statewide. The pertussis component of DTaP and Tdap vaccines and the influenza vaccine are the best protection against infection. Protection is highest among those fully vaccinated, but that protection decreases over time.

""Pertussis or whooping cough can be a very serious illness,"" said Dr. Joshua Clayton, State Epidemiologist for the Department of Health. ""Taking preventative measures like washing hands often and staying current with the pertussis vaccine helps protect you and your family.""

During respiratory season, we encourage all South Dakotans to take the following steps to avoid becoming sick or spreading disease:
- Avoid close contact with sick people;
- If sick, limit contact with others;
- Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze;
- Cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve or elbow, not your hands, if you don't have a tissue;
- Wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand gel; and
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.

Pertussis is spread from person to person when breathing in respiratory particles from an infected person. The respiratory particles are spread when a person with pertussis sneezes or coughs. It usually takes 7 to 10 days after exposure to develop symptoms. Early symptoms resemble the common cold with runny nose, low-grade fever, and mild cough which are more severe at night. Later symptoms (within 2 weeks) include numerous rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched whoop, and mucus discharge or vomiting following a coughing episode.

Antibacterials are effective at stopping a person who is sick from spreading pertussis. Five days of treatment is needed to stop the bacterium from spreading, even though the person may continue to cough. Without antimicrobials, a person can spread the pertussis bacteria for 21 days.

Public health officials said they are now dealing with a measles outbreak in southwestern Ontario, with 19 confirmed cases as of January 29 [2025].

Southwestern Public Health, which covers Oxford County, Elgin County and the City of St. Thomas, is reporting 3 cases of the highly contagious disease in children. The remaining 16 infections are with Grand Erie Public Health, which serves the City of Brantford, Brant County, Haldimand County and Norfolk County. In an update Friday [24 Jan 2025], officials said 13 children and 3 adults have measles.

""When this started, we were looking at this being just a cluster of cases that were occurring predominantly in a non-immunized group,"" explained Dr. Malcolm Lock, the acting medical officer of health for Grand Erie Public Health. ""We've now moved to calling it an outbreak because of the numbers that are very rapidly increasing and the numbers that we think are going to continue to increase.""

He said the main concern with measles is how quickly it can spread. ""If we had [a sick person] in an unimmunized or susceptible group, they are potentially going to infect 12 to 18 people,"" Lock explained. ""I can't emphasize more the contagiousness of this disease.""

The outbreak in southwestern Ontario, said both health units, is linked to a specific community. ""This is in a population that does not support vaccination,"" Lock said, clarifying that the people are predominantly unvaccinated or under-vaccinated.

That has presented a significant problem in terms of tracking infections. Grand Erie Public Health said once they are aware of a measles case, they can check the provincial database to investigate the person's vaccination status. ""We don't have any specific information mainly because there are groups in that area that do not support vaccination,"" Lock explained. ""Therefore, it's very difficult to get an estimate on the number of those people that we have that are unvaccinated.""

Another complication is that the children go to a private school and can choose not to cooperate with public health. ""Sometimes that information is difficult to get from the schools,"" Lock explained. ""They are reluctant to release that. I can understand that because it can be a personal information issue, and a [Personal Health Information Protection Act] issue, that they don't want to release it. Without that information though, there's no way that we have to adequately check the contacts of any cases that occur, particularly in the schools.""

Grand Erie Public Health said they have shared information on measles and vaccinations with schools and churches in the community on multiple occasions, as well as material that can be shared with parents. ""That is about as much as we can do from a legal perspective,"" Lock added.

According to Public Health Ontario, 65 measles infections were reported across the province between January 2024 and January 2025. They included 39 confirmed and 26 probable cases. The illnesses were also spread out across 11 different public health units.

The data from Ontario's integrated Public Health Information System, which was last updated on January 15 [2025], showed 5 infections with Grand Erie Public Health (which took over for the Brant County Health Unit and Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit in 2025) and 26 with Southwestern Public Health. It also showed a total of 8 hospitalizations and 1 death due to measles. Measles has been on an upward trend in the province since 2023, which Public Health Ontario said is in line with an increase in global cases of the disease.

Dr. Ninh Tran, the medical officer of health for Southwestern Public Health, called the measles vaccine ""really safe and effective."" Its efficacy, he added, is much higher than some other shots.

""I think the only effective method of preventing this disease is by vaccination,"" Lock said. ""Complications to measles in young children is fairly uncommon and rare, or has been up until now. I think that if we can prevent one serious illness, or even one death, from a child by vaccinating the population, [we should try] to get as near to herd the immunity status as we can.""

If enough people get vaccinated, he explained, vulnerable populations will have an even lower risk of catching the disease. ""It's important that people realize that if they choose not to be vaccinated, and increase their susceptibility to these childhood diseases, I think they're putting children at risk,"" Lock stated.

He said efforts to vaccinate a majority of the population were so effective that, for some, it's not a priority. ""They haven't seen these illnesses and, of course, we haven't seen the complications,"" Lock explained. ""Those complications still exist, rare though they may be, but they can be significant and lead to serious, life-long illnesses.""

Lock admits local health units are facing an uphill battle. ""My concern is that we have seen, as everyone is aware I'm sure, the uptake of vaccines, in general, has been falling off, rather than increasing,"" he said on Wednesday [29 Jan 2025]. ""We, public health, have a lot of work to do. Because I believe that people, the people that support non-vaccines or anti-vaccines groups, are sending out far more messages, probably, than we are."" Lock said that is key to addressing current and future problems.

""I think public health needs to improve our messaging and try to find out what is the reasoning behind...younger people not achieving vaccine status and refusing vaccines. One can certainly assume that if that trend continues, we are going to see an increased number of not only measles, but other problems associated with vaccine prevention. Not the least of which, of course, is polio.""

One reason measles is so highly contagious is that it is an airborne disease that can hang around in the air up to 2 hours after an infected person has left. Anyone with the illness is also contagious 4 days before, and up to 4 days after, the rash appears. Symptoms usually start anytime between 7 and 21 days after exposure.

Anyone who suspects they have been exposed to the measles is asked to take extra precautions. ""They should really stay home and avoid high-risk settings,"" advised Lock. ""That would be doctor's offices, childcare facilities, hospital emergency rooms, etc.""

At least 4 cases of measles, including 2 involving school-aged children, have been reported in Texas in less than 2 weeks, putting state health agencies on alert. For some communities, this is the first case of measles in more than 20 years.

Laura Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said the agency sent out an alert to health providers statewide once measles were confirmed to be found in 2 adult residents in Harris County last week [23 Jan 2025]. The alert stated that both individuals reside in the same household and were unvaccinated against measles. These were the first confirmed cases of measles reported in Texas since 2023, when 2 were reported.

Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease. General symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, and a full-body rash. This disease can cause serious health consequences and even death, especially for young and unvaccinated children.

About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people in the United States who get measles will be hospitalized, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Up to 3 of every 1000 children who become infected with measles may die from respiratory and neurologic complications.

Houston Health Department officials say the cases of measles were associated with the pair's recent international travel and released a list of possible locations and dates where members of the public might have been exposed.

The state health agency also confirmed 2 measles cases in the South Plains, both involving school-aged children who were not vaccinated. Anton said they were hospitalized and have since been discharged.

Katherine Wells, the Lubbock Health Department's health director, said the children were treated at a Lubbock health care facility. They were from the area, but not Lubbock residents. Wells said at this time, there are no known sites of exposure outside the health care facility where they were tested. Since Lubbock is the medical hub for the South Plains, they traveled to Lubbock for testing.

""We're working with the South Plains Public Health District and our medical partners to work and identify where there could have been some community exposures,"" Wells said. The state health agency is helping with the disease investigation in Lubbock and the South Plains region.

Wells said the community should be aware of the cases, as well as health care professionals who see rashes or high fevers from their patients. ""We want people to know there were some cases here,"" Wells said. ""So if they have concerns and are unvaccinated, call your health provider or the health department for more information."" Wells said that the last measles case in Lubbock County was in 2004.

Austin Public Health has also sent an alert about the potential measles outbreak, urging residents to take proactive measures to protect themselves and their families. The last confirmed measles case in the city of Austin was in December 2019.

""Vaccination is our best defense against measles and other preventable diseases,"" said Desmar Walkes, medical director and health authority for Austin/Travis County. ""By staying up to date on vaccinations, we not only protect ourselves but also the most vulnerable members of our community.""

The recent upswing in cases statewide comes as the measles vaccination rate among kindergarteners has dropped, from almost 97% in the 2019-2020 school year to 94.3% in 2023-24. Texas is among the majority of states that have seen vaccination declines since the pandemic.

In March 2024, there were already more reported cases of measles than in all of 2023, according to the CDC.

A result of the country's vaccination program, measles was officially eliminated from the United States in 2000, meaning the disease has not spread continuously for over 12 months. Experts recommend that children get the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine in 2 doses: the first between 12 months and 15 months of age and the second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles infection, and 2 doses are about 97% effective.

Vaccine proponents fear statewide disease trends will worsen as Texas lawmakers this legislative session try to weaken vaccine mandates and more families opt out of immunizations. Since 2018, the requests to the Texas Department of State Health Services for an exemption form have doubled from 45 900 to more than 93 000 in 2024.

Lawmakers have filed more than 20 vaccination-related bills, including a House joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Texas Constitution to preserve Texans' right to refuse vaccination. President Donald Trump's re-election and his selection of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his choice for US Health and Human Services secretary has boosted the vaccine choice movement. Kennedy has previously made controversial comments about vaccines, which include linking them to autism in children.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Polio has threatened the health and wellbeing of children for centuries, but today it is largely a forgotten disease for the vast majority of people living in Europe. Polio vaccination has undeniably been one of the most successful public health interventions in Europe and worldwide. Thanks to successful immunization programs, surveillance and outbreak response, Europe was declared free of endemic polio in 2002 and has since maintained this status every year (1) [complete references can be found at the source URL above - Mod.LL].

Nonetheless, until global eradication is achieved and as long as poliovirus is circulating anywhere, importations into Europe are inevitable. Data from poliovirus surveillance systems show that pathogenic poliovirus was detected in at least one of the countries in Europe in every year from 2015 through 2022 (2). It is paramount that we see every importation of any harmful poliovirus into Europe as a wake-up call -- polio may be forgotten by many, but it is not gone, and it still poses a risk to the unvaccinated in Europe and every other region in the world.

The unusually high number of poliovirus detections in recent months has reinforced the urgency of the wake-up call. From September through December 2024, vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) was detected in wastewater systems of 14 cities in 5 European countries (3-5): consecutively in Spain, Poland (6), Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), and Finland. The isolated VDPV2 viruses are linked to a lineage (NIE-ZAS-1) that was first detected in Nigeria in July 2020, and which has travelled in the intervening years to 21 other countries in Africa, causing outbreaks in 15 of them (WHO data, not shown) (7).

Genetic sequencing analysis of the European isolates identified divergence from the closest known NIE-ZAS-1 isolates, indicating that before detection in Europe, the virus had been circulating elsewhere undetected for about 1 year. Additionally, and remarkably, the analysis indicated wide genetic variation between the European isolates, both between countries, and within countries, and even between isolates from the same sampling site (3,4). This suggests an unusual event in which multiple nearly simultaneous and apparently independent importations likely occurred, from a location outside the catchment areas of European poliovirus surveillance networks.

To date, there is no evidence that widespread local circulation has occurred in Europe from the 2024 VDPV2 importations described above; however, importations of polioviruses can and do lead to outbreaks if the virus finds its way to unvaccinated individuals.

This recently occurred in Tajikistan (8) and Ukraine (9) in 2021, and Israel (10) and the UK (11) in 2022. In 2022 and 2023, VDPV2 outbreaks affected countries which had high overall vaccination coverage but localized pockets of under-immunised communities with tight social linkage; in addition to Israel and the UK, genetically linked VDPV2 isolates were detected in Canada and the United States, and the outbreak resulted in 2 paralytic cases of polio in unvaccinated individuals in New York State (12) and North Israel (13).

Those outbreaks were a painful reminder that despite overall high national coverage, as long as countries have sub-populations that are under-vaccinated, the steady stream of poliovirus importations could find fertile ground leading to circulation and to paralytic cases. This can and must be prevented.

In general, the 5 countries reporting VDPV2 detection in 2024 have maintained high national immunization coverage with 3 doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), but all countries have experienced disparities in sub-national communities (in Germany, Finland, Poland, Spain and the UK collectively, sub-national coverage of the third dose of polio-containing vaccine in 2023 ranged from 43% to >99%), leaving some populations chronically under-vaccinated and dangerously vulnerable to poliovirus infection and risk of paralysis if exposed to imported virus. Within the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimated that during the 10-year period from 2012 to 2021, about 2.4 million children between 12 and 23 months of age may not have received the required 3 doses of polio-containing vaccine to ensure they are protected (14). Updated estimates have added another 600 000 children for the years 2022 and 2023 who may have missed their vaccination (15). To minimize the risk of outbreaks, countries have to take urgent action to identify un- and under-vaccinated individuals and sub-populations and develop intensified and innovative programmes to fill these immunity gaps.

The ECDC most recently published a Rapid Risk Assessment on these multiple detections that sets out the key priority actions that all countries in Europe should undertake, urgently, to prevent or curb any possible local transmission of polioviruses (15). The World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe has also published guidance to support countries in identifying, addressing and tracking inequities in immunisation, following a step-wise approach that includes data triangulation and analysis, formative research to identify barriers to vaccination, and tailored programme policies, strategies and practices to increase uptake (16).

A future without polio remains our goal, but it is by no means a certainty. The continuing spread of polioviruses globally and the increased frequency of poliovirus detections in the past year in Europe and neighbouring regions make the path towards eradication look increasingly fragile. As laid out in the European Immunization Agenda 2030 (17), the GPEI Polio eradication strategy (18) and the Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan 2025-2026 (19): every country must remain vigilant -- to detect the presence of polioviruses through sensitive surveillance systems; prepared -- to act quickly if any circulation is detected; and committed -- to sustain high vaccination coverage in every community every year until global polio eradication has been achieved. Lack of sustained progress in any of these areas heightens the risk of a polio outbreak, and with it the potential for sustained transmission, loss of our polio-free status and a major setback on the path towards global eradication.

The WHO and ECDC continue their close cooperation to support national and local public health authorities in these efforts, including the provision of technical guidance and resources for effective surveillance and outbreak response, facilitating data exchange and genetic sequencing for tracking of poliovirus strains, and assisting in the development and implementation of targeted risk communication and community engagement strategies to increase vaccine acceptance and enhance immunisation uptake, all while maintaining vigilant and ongoing monitoring of the situation (20-22).

The last stages of the global polio eradication strategy grapple with the outstanding challenges of eliminating wild polioviruses in endemic countries on the one hand and putting a halt to outbreaks caused by circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) on the other. In addition, we must do all we can to prevent, by all means, the resurgence of polio in polio-free areas. Europe remains committed to do its part in the context of all relentless global efforts in this direction and has full capacity to do so successfully.

In the face of increasing wild poliovirus transmission in the last 2 remaining endemic countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, global health experts gathered in Islamabad last week to evaluate measures to urgently reverse the epidemiological trend.

The Technical Advisory Group (TAG) meeting on polio eradication came at a critical time for Pakistan, as the country faces a resurgence of wild poliovirus (WPV1) cases and a narrowing window to interrupt transmission by the end of 2025. With 73 WPV cases reported in 2024 compared to just 6 in 2023, and a significant increase in environmental detections across historic poliovirus reservoirs like Karachi, Peshawar, and Quetta, and beyond, the pressure to demonstrate results has never been greater. The meeting underscored the urgent need for extraordinary efforts and emergency operational measures to get the programme back on track and restore national and international confidence in the success of the longstanding effort.

The Technical Advisory Group was convened by the WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Dr Hanan Balkhy on behalf of Member States and the [GPEI] partners. In her opening remarks, she emphasized the importance of reaching children being missed, particularly in insecure, underserved, high-risk areas and among migrant and mobile populations.

The group highlighted the need to focus on areas where the virus has returned or continues to spread, particularly in parts of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, central Pakistan, and urban centers. New approaches are required to ensure every child is reached, especially in areas where security issues and logistical challenges make vaccination campaigns difficult. While progress has been made in certain areas, more needs to be done to ensure high-quality vaccination campaigns and close gaps where children are being missed.

Experts outlined specific milestones that must be achieved by mid-2025 to reverse the widespread poliovirus transmission:
- Interrupt polio transmission in the northern corridor (Peshawar Bloc), in the central Pakistan zone (northern Sindh, southern Punjab, eastern Baluchistan), and across Lahore, Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
- Substantially reduce the presence of the virus in environmental samples in Karachi, the Quetta Bloc and southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
- Prevent further outbreaks in any areas that have recently detected or will detect poliovirus.

The next 6 months are considered critical for making progress, with efforts focused on delivering effective vaccination campaigns and addressing challenges in hard-to-reach areas. To meet these ambitious targets, the quality of vaccination campaigns must improve to reach children who continue to be missed. Missing children repeatedly remains the single largest challenge for the program. Pakistan's current implementation of the ""2-4-6 strategy"" should continue focusing on strengthening program management and accountability, enhancing the quality of Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs), and improving access to children in areas affected by insecurity.

Significant interventions, innovations, and assessments have been introduced under this strategy. However, the improvements have not yet translated into better SIA quality. Ensuring access to all children, particularly in high-risk areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, is essential to getting the program back on track. Additionally, special attention must be paid to mobile and migrant populations (MMPs) and to maintaining high-quality immunization efforts in border districts where the virus risks being sustained. The TAG recommended specific benchmarks of quality and indicators of missed children that the program must meet to achieve the recommended milestones for reversing poliovirus transmission trends by June 2025.

Despite these challenges, there are significant opportunities for Pakistan to make strong progress in 2025. With committed political and administrative leadership, enhanced security support, and especially the Prime Minister's regular Stock Takes, the programme can capitalize on this momentum to build a national movement for the ""last push."" Other key areas of focus include improving the morale and motivation of frontline workers, expanding routine immunization coverage through the EPI, and leveraging the Big Catch Up campaigns to address gaps in immunization.

A review in June 2025 will assess the programme's trajectory and identify any urgent course corrections needed to sustain progress. The close interdependence between Pakistan and Afghanistan in eradicating polio further underscores the need for cross-border collaboration. As one country's progress influences the other, maintaining high-quality efforts in border areas will be critical. The next TAG meeting for Afghanistan, planned for February [2025], will further align strategies to tackle these shared challenges.

At the TAG meeting, Madam Ayesha Raza Farooq, the Prime Minister's Focal Person on Polio Eradication in Pakistan, emphasized the solidarity of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) with countries striving to protect future generations from polio. She highlighted the importance of collaboration among partners, governments, civil society, religious leaders, and frontline workers to overcome challenges and ensure that no child is left behind on the path to a polio-free Pakistan.

""Like the moon landing, polio eradication is a challenge that tests our collective resolve and compels us to achieve the extraordinary,"" said Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme and Deputy Director-General of WHO, speaking at the TAG meeting. ""The last mile is the hardest. It's the least crowded mile, full of risks and failures waiting to confront you. But it is also where true determination and resilience shine. I have every confidence that Pakistan, alongside Afghanistan, will achieve polio eradication. Together, you will land on the moon,"" he added.

Middlesex-London Health Unit reports multiple measles exposures at 2 local hospitals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the number of measles cases continues to climb across the province, officials with the Middlesex-London Health Unit reported on Friday [31 Jan 2025] that there have been multiple exposures to confirmed cases recently at 2 local hospitals. The exposures occurred in the emergency departments of Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital on 19 and 23 Jan 2025, and the pediatric emergency department of London's Children's Hospital on 24, 25, and 28 Jan 2025, the health unit said Friday [31 Jan 2025].

Specifically, the health unit says the exposures occurred on:

- 19 Jan 2025 between 9:10 p.m. and 11:10 p.m. at Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital's ER;
- 23 Jan 2025 between 3:45 p.m. and 8:15 p.m. at Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital's ER;
- 24/25 Jan 2025 between 8:30 p.m. and midnight in the waiting room of Children's Hospital's pediatric ER;
- 24/25 Jan 2025 between 8:45 p.m. and 3 a.m. in Children's Hospital's pediatric ER;
- 28 Jan 2025 between 10 a.m. and 2:45 p.m. in the waiting room of Children's Hospital's pediatric ER; and
- 28 Jan 2025 between 11:20 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. in Children's Hospital's pediatric ER.

Dr. Joanne Kearon, associate medical officer of health with the Middlesex-London Health Unit, said those infected were from neighboring health units, and that no measles cases had been confirmed in Middlesex County.

Those potentially exposed are asked to check their immunization record, and ensure they and whoever they were [with] are up to date on their vaccinations or are otherwise immune, she said.

Two doses of the measles vaccine are recommended for anyone born in or after 1970. In Canada, the vaccine is only available in the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine.

""If someone has been exposed and is immunocompromised, not immune, or was accompanied by an unvaccinated infant, we'd ask that they call us at MLHU so we can assess whether they're eligible for post-exposure treatment,"" Kearon said. ""We are following up on all the contacts we are aware of related to these exposures, prioritizing children under the age of one and people that we know are immunocompromised. However, at this time, we have no reports or people that we are investigating as cases.""

Public Health Ontario has reported an uptick in measles cases in recent weeks, most involving children. As of 29 Jan [2025], the province said it had seen 26 confirmed and 27 probable cases since October [2024] involving 41 children and 12 adults. Of the 53 cases, reported by Grand Erie Public Health, Grey Bruce Health, and Southwestern Public Health, only 6 involved patients who were vaccinated against measles, the province says.

On Wednesday [29 Jan 2025], Grand Erie and Southwestern health units declared measles outbreaks connected to at least 19 patients in their communities, mostly children, who had fallen ill in recent weeks. In comparison, the province as a whole saw an average of 7 measles cases per year between 2013 and 2019. No cases were reported in 2020 or 2021, one case was reported in 2022, and 7 in 2023.

The National Ministry of Health issued an epidemiological alert after confirming a case of imported measles in a 6-year-old girl in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA). The minor, of Russian-Argentine nationality, arrived in the country on January 22 [2025] from Russia, with stops in Viet Nam, Dubai and Brazil. The diagnosis was confirmed through laboratory tests at the Ricardo Guti√©rrez Children's Hospital and the ""Carlos G. Malbr√°n"" National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INEI-ANLIS).

The patient presented fever and exanthema (skin rash) days after her arrival, which prompted her medical attention. Currently, she is in good general condition and is complying with home isolation. Health authorities began investigation and contact tracing to prevent the spread of the virus.

Although Argentina eliminated the endemic circulation of measles in 2000, imported cases represent a significant risk, especially in contexts of low vaccine coverage. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 320 000 confirmed cases of measles were reported in 184 countries in 2024, reflecting a global increase in the disease.

Three children aged 1-7 years old in village 3, Tra Leng commune, Nam Tra My district died of suspected rash fever, of which 2 children had fever and diarrhea but were not taken for timely treatment.

On February 4 [2025], Dr. Mai Van Muoi, Director of the Quang Nam Department of Health, said that during the recent Lunar New Year, a number of cases of rash fever in children appeared in the mountainous commune of Tra Leng. To date, there have been 3 deaths.

The first 2 cases were a 7-year-old and a 3-year-old child who died on the first and second days of Tet. Before that, the 2 children had fever and diarrhea, and were advised by village health workers to go to the health station, but the family did not follow the advice. The children suffered from severe dehydration and exhaustion, leading to death. The third case was a 3-year-old boy who died, but the cause is unknown and the health agency is verifying.

According to Mr. Muoi, Tra Leng commune before and after Tet recorded 43 cases of rash fever in children aged 1-12, all of whom were taken to medical facilities for treatment. Of these, 31 children were transferred to Nam Tra My District Medical Center; currently 8 children have been discharged from the hospital, [and] 23 are being treated.

At Tra Leng commune health station, there are 12 children, of which 6 have recovered [and] the remaining 6 are still receiving care. The children's health condition is stable; they are alert and able to eat.

Through epidemiological investigation, the Department of Health said that among the 43 cases, there were children who had been vaccinated against measles, but there were also children who had not been vaccinated or were not old enough to be vaccinated.

In response, the Department of Health directed local authorities and relevant agencies to encourage families to take sick children to medical facilities for timely isolation and treatment. At the same time, relevant agencies screened children in the area who had not yet received vaccinations to avoid the risk of spreading the disease.

Rash fever is a condition of fever accompanied by red spots on the skin, commonly found in children, but can also occur in adults. Fever with rash all over the body can be caused by many reasons such as infection, virus, parasite, fungus, drug, autoimmune disease, malignancy.

Measles case passes through Darwin, NT Health issue alert
-------------------------------------------------
Territorians are being urged to be on the alert for signs and symptoms of measles after a confirmed case in the greater Darwin region last week.

On Sunday [2 Feb 2025], NT Health released an alert after it was discovered an adult had traveled through Darwin airport while infectious. It is understood the case had recently traveled to South-East Asia, where measles outbreaks have occurred across multiple countries.

The case attended several locations, including:

Fri 24 Jan 2025:
- Air North Flight TL160 from Darwin to Cairns (stopover in Gove);

Mon 27 Jan 2025:
- Air North Flight TL161 from Cairns to Darwin (stopover in Gove);
- Darwin International Airport arrivals and luggage pickup, 4 p.m. - 5 p.m.

Tue 28 Jan 2025:
- Mckinnon Snack Bar and Takeaway Berrimah, 9 a.m. - 9:30 a.m.

Measles is a highly infectious viral illness which is spread by breathing in the airborne droplets from the coughs and sneezes of people infected with the disease. Starting as a flu-like illness and lasting between 2 and 4 days, symptoms include fever, sore or red eyes, runny nose, and cough, followed by a red, blotchy rash that spreads from the face and neck over the rest of the body. Due to high levels of immunization, measles is now uncommon in Australia, with the latest case the seventh travel-associated measles case confirmed in Australia this year [2025]. The most recent case of measles in the Territory was in 2019.

""We don't usually focus on measles because children get the vaccine before school begins, but once you get the measles vaccine, it protects you for life,"" she said. ""Thus far, we have administered 2298 vaccines for measles in 2023, and in 2024, we administered 2561 vaccines.""

Craig emphasized that measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness. She said that symptoms can include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, and a full-body rash. For young and unvaccinated children, the disease can cause health issues and even death.

""You are contagious for up to 4 days before the rash even appears on your body,"" she explained. ""If the rash and other symptoms appear, then you do want to isolate. If you are school age, then you must stay home from school; if you are an adult, then stay home from work.""

Measles is transmitted via direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread once an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes.

""The measles virus can remain infectious in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person leaves an area. Illness onset (high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes) begins a week or 2 after someone is exposed,"" according to the Texas Department of State Health Services in a press release.

Craig said that the purpose of receiving the measles vaccine is herd immunity. ""The likelihood of a disease spreading through the community is greatly reduced once someone is vaccinated,"" she said. ""Even with one dose, it is 93 percent effective. To protect yourself within your community and also while traveling abroad, where these vaccines may not be common practice, you should receive the vaccine.""

Craig said that measles was declared eliminated in 2000. However, she said there are still gaps in other areas where the disease spreading.

""I just wanted to emphasize that when it comes to prevention, one dose is 93% effective, 2 doses is 97% effective,"" she explained. ""The best way to protect yourself and your family is vaccination.""

For those who are curious if they have received the vaccine, a state database in Texas is available by calling the Texas Department of State Health Services. For those residing in other states, Craig advised residents to call their doctor or pediatrician.

""There is an immunization registry,"" she said. ""And if someone received a vaccine, the information will be available for them to find out.""

--------------------------------------------------
Thirty-one people are known to have died of measles out of a total number of 1191 cases diagnosed in central and northern Mozambique between 9 Jul [2024] and 28 Jan [2025]. At a Friday [31 Jan 2025] press conference in Maputo on the epidemiological situation in the country, the Deputy National Director of Public Health, Aleny Couto, said Nampula is currently the only province with an active measles outbreak. However, there have been no new cases notified in the previous 24 hours, and for the past 14 days there have been no measles deaths.

The measles cases were reported in Cabo Delgado, Niassa, and Nampula in the north, and in the central provinces of Zambezia and Sofala.

[Of the 1191 cases,] 428 cases were diagnosed in Niassa, 351 in Nampula, 341 in Cabo Delgado, 42 in Sofala, and 29 in Zambezia. Of the 31 known measles deaths, 17 were in Cabo Delgado, 11 in Nampula, and 3 in Niassa.

Three children aged 1-7 years old in village 3, Tra Leng commune, Nam Tra My district died of suspected rash fever, of which 2 children had fever and diarrhea but were not taken for timely treatment.

On 4 Feb 2025, Dr. Mai Van Muoi, Director of the Quang Nam Department of Health, said that during the recent Lunar New Year, a number of cases of rash fever in children appeared in the mountainous commune of Tra Leng. To date, there have been 3 deaths.

The 1st 2 cases were a 7-year-old and a 3-year-old child who died on the 1st and 2nd days of Tet. Before that, the 2 children had fever and diarrhea, and were advised by village health workers to go to the health station, but the family did not follow the advice. The children suffered from severe dehydration and exhaustion, leading to death. The third case was a 3-year-old boy who died, but the cause is unknown and the health agency is verifying.

According to Mr. Muoi, Tra Leng commune before and after Tet recorded 43 cases of rash fever in children aged 1-12, all of whom were taken to medical facilities for treatment. Of these, 31 children were transferred to Nam Tra My District Medical Center; currently 8 children have been discharged from the hospital, 23 are being treated.

At Tra Leng commune health station, there are 12 children, of which 6 have recovered [and] the remaining 6 are still receiving care. The children's health condition is stable; they are alert and able to eat.

Through epidemiological investigation, the Department of Health said that among the 43 cases, there were children who had been vaccinated against measles, but there were also children who had not been vaccinated or were not old enough to be vaccinated.

In response, the Department of Health directed local authorities and relevant agencies to encourage families to take sick children to medical facilities for timely isolation and treatment. At the same time, relevant agencies screened children in the area who had not yet received vaccinations to avoid the risk of spreading the disease.

Rash fever is a condition of fever accompanied by red spots on the skin, commonly found in children, but can also occur in adults. Fever with rash all over the body can be caused by many reasons such as infection, virus, parasite, fungus, drug, autoimmune disease, malignancy.

Jammu and Kashmir has reported a significant number of mumps cases over the past 2 years, according to data presented in the Rajya Sabha by Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Prataprao Jadhav. The information, part of an official response to an unstarred question by MP AA Rahim, highlights a troubling rise in mumps outbreaks across the country, with a particular focus on Jammu and Kashmir.

As per government records, Jammu and Kashmir saw 450 reported cases of mumps in 2023, marking one of the highest incidences in India for that year. The situation continued into 2024, albeit with a lower count of 95 cases. In addition, the Union Territory of Ladakh, which had no recorded cases in previous years, reported 111 cases in 2024. Despite these alarming figures, there have been no reported deaths from mumps in Jammu and Kashmir or anywhere else in the country during the period under review.

Mumps, a contagious viral disease, is preventable through the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. However, the government clarified that mumps vaccination is not currently part of India's Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP), which provides free vaccines against 12 other preventable diseases. This has raised concerns among public health experts regarding the potential vulnerability of children in the region, particularly given the fluctuating number of cases.

The overall burden of mumps in India has seen a sharp increase, with 4145 cases reported across different states in 2024, compared to 1194 cases in 2023. Kerala recorded the highest number of cases in 2024 at 1579, followed by Tamil Nadu with 1067 cases. The presence of outbreaks in Jammu and Kashmir underscores the need for enhanced surveillance, public awareness campaigns, and potential policy revisions regarding vaccine inclusion.

While health authorities in Jammu and Kashmir have been actively monitoring and responding to outbreaks, medical experts stress the importance of preventive measures such as vaccination, maintaining hygiene, and early diagnosis to curb the spread of the disease. Parents and caregivers have also been urged to remain vigilant and seek timely medical attention for children showing symptoms such as swelling of salivary glands, fever, and muscle pain.

Bermuda investigating possible case of measles
---------------------------------------
Bermuda health authorities on Tuesday [4 Feb 2025] said they are investigating a suspected case of measles and that public health measures are being implemented, including the identification and notification of people who may have had a potential measles exposure.

In a statement, the Ministry of Health's Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit said the health measures are initiated as a timely response is critical to preventing potential outbreaks. It gave no details regarding the suspected case. But it said that given the highly contagious nature of measles, timely response, case investigation, contact tracing, and immunisation efforts help to prevent potential spread while confirmatory testing is underway.

The ministry noted the importance of measles awareness and prevention, adding that vaccination is crucial in reducing the risk of catching and spreading measles. It said that anyone who has not received both doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine -- particularly children and young adults -- should follow the below guidance to protect themselves and others.

""Vaccination remains the most effective protection against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. If you haven't yet received both doses of the MMR vaccine, now is the time to act. Protect yourself and those around you from this highly contagious and potentially serious disease,"" said Minister of Health Kim Wilson. ""We must work together to prevent the potential spread of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. We encourage parents to ensure their children are immunised according to the recommended schedule. Vaccination is a simple yet powerful way to stay safe and safeguard our community.""

The authorities said that the first symptoms of measles are fever, tiredness, cough, runny nose, sore red eyes, and feeling unwell. A few days later a rash appears. The rash starts on the face, spreads down to the body, and lasts for 4-7 days.

The Ministry of Education and Sport, Morocco has responded to the current situation of the measles outbreak in the country by the following prevention and control measures including allowing the infected children to be absentee from school till full recovery, mandatory vaccination of all unvaccinated pupils in collaboration with ministry of health and closure of the schools that might be outbreak foci with the adoption of remote education. The current outbreak was attributed to the lowering of vaccination rate as a result of anti-vaccine campaigns in the community. The MOH is working on raising the public awareness about the importance of vaccination.

Provincial public health officials are warning Manitobans of possible exposure to measles. Officials say there have been 5 confirmed cases of measles in southern Manitoba, all connected to an outbreak in Ontario. All of the affected individuals are from the same household and had recently travelled to Ontario. They have all been asked to isolate at home.

[A total of] 81 cases of measles have been reported in Ontario in 2024 and 2025.

Anyone who attended the main service or Sunday school at Reinland Mennonite Church in Winkler on January 26 [2025] may have been exposed. Also, anyone who attended the Health Sciences Centre 4th-floor cardiology clinic, 1st-floor child laboratory or Children's Hospital waiting room on January 31 [2025] between 11:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. may have been exposed. Those who may have been exposed are asked to monitor symptoms until February 16 and 21 [2025], respectively.

Symptoms of measles typically appear 7 to 21 days after exposure. Initial symptoms may include fever, runny nose, drowsiness, irritability and red eyes. Small white spots may also develop on the inside of the mouth or throat.

Measles is a highly infectious communicable disease that is spread through droplets in the air formed when coughing or sneezing.

The public health investigation is ongoing and additional exposure locations may be added. As more contacts are identified, individuals may be asked to isolate.

York Region Public Health is warning the public about possible exposures to a confirmed case of measles in Newmarket last week. According to officials, the potential exposures occurred at a hotel in Newmarket and the Magna Centre.

Anyone who attended the Best Western Voyageur Place Hotel, located at 17565 Yonge Street, between 2 p.m. on Friday [31 Jan 2025] and 11:30 a.m. on Saturday [1 Feb 2025] may have been exposed to measles, officials said. York Region Public Health said those who visited the Magna Centre, located at 800 Mulock Drive, from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Friday [31 Jan 2025] may have also been exposed to the virus.

""If you were present at the above times and locations and you were with an infant under 6 months of age, you are pregnant or if you are immunocompromised, please call York Region Public Health immediately as you may be eligible for preventive treatment,"" officials said in a news release issued this week.

The York Region Public Health Unit said this particular care of measles is associated with an outbreak in the Grand Erie Health Unit.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has assessed the risk of a measles outbreak in Vi·ªát Nam as very high and recommends large-scale vaccination campaigns in provinces and cities with high and very high risk, as well as in areas currently experiencing measles case clusters.

For provinces and cities with low and medium risk, WHO advises conducting reviews for catch-up vaccinations for children who missed doses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2024, Vi·ªát Nam reported more than 45 550 suspected measles cases, including 7583 confirmed infections and 16 deaths linked to the disease.

Approximately one-fourth of confirmed cases occurred in infants under 9 months of age, a group not yet eligible for routine measles vaccination under national guidelines. Health authorities noted that most cases involved unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children or those too young to receive the vaccine.

WHO emphasised that in countries with active measles transmission, the first dose of the measles vaccine should be administered at 9 months, followed by a second dose for children aged 15 to 18 months.

During outbreaks, the agency recommends an additional supplementary dose for infants aged 6 to 9 months to curb transmission. These early doses, WHO stressed, are safe and effective in protecting vulnerable infants during epidemics.

Since September 2024, Vi·ªát Nam's Ministry of Health has rolled out measles vaccination campaigns for children aged 1-10 years across 31 provinces. Seven provinces have completed the campaign's first phase, while 24 others continue efforts to administer initial and follow-up doses.

Looking ahead, the Ministry of Health has drafted a 2025 measles prevention plan targeting high-risk areas. Children aged 6 months to under 9 months in 24 provinces with active outbreaks will be prioritised, alongside those aged 1 to 10 years in designated regions. Healthcare workers treating measles patients who are not fully vaccinated will also be included.

The 2025 campaign will unfold in 2 phases. Phase 1 will cover provinces listed under Decisions No. 2495/Qƒê-BYT and 3526/Qƒê-BYT, while Phase 2 will expand to 17 more provinces, including Th√°i B√¨nh, H√† Nam and B·∫Øc Giang. Local authorities will determine specific age groups for vaccination based on outbreak severity and vaccine availability, according to the Ministry of Health.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday [7 Feb 2025] confirmed one imported case of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis in Singapore, adding that its findings so far indicate a low risk of community transmission. The patient is a 5-month-old female Indonesian infant who arrived on January 26 [2025] for medical treatment.

MOH said the case is immunocompromised and was previously vaccinated with one dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and one dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in Indonesia. She had developed fever, acute floppiness and paralysis of the lower limbs in December 2024 while in Indonesia. Poliomyelitis was not suspected by her doctor then, said the ministry.

On January 26 [2025], she was medically evacuated for treatment of her symptoms and admitted directly to the National University Hospital (NUH) upon arrival in Singapore. The infant is currently in stable condition.

""Our findings so far indicate low risk of community transmission. The case was conveyed directly to NUH upon arrival in Singapore and isolated upon admission. She was also placed under the appropriate infection prevention and control precautions to prevent further spread once suspected of poliomyelitis infection,"" said MOH. ""Currently 3 close contacts, who are family members or caregivers of the case, have been quarantined as a precautionary measure.""

Poliomyelitis is caused by the poliovirus and is mainly transmitted through food infected with faecal material.

What is polio?
Poliomyelitis, more commonly known as polio, is a highly infectious disease that can affect muscles and nerves.

This can lead to permanent paralysis of the limbs in a small number of people. Most people infected with polio will not have any symptoms or have only minor symptoms which often go away completely, according to the HealthHub portal.

Polio is spread by contact with infected people, such as via oral contact with body fluids or faecal material. Some symptoms that can happen at the beginning include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness and pain in the limbs.

The disease can take several forms. Those who contract nonparalytic polio may experience severe flulike symptoms. This illness does not cause paralysis, says Mayo Clinic.

Paralytic polio is considered the most serious form of the disease. Signs and symptoms include intense pain, tingling or prickling sensations, muscle spasms, as well as muscle weakness progressing to limp paralysis.

In particularly severe cases, Mayo Clinic also notes that patients may experience paralysis of muscles involved in breathing and difficulty swallowing.

Vaccination
Vaccination is the most effective protection against poliomyelitis, alongside maintaining high standards of hygiene and sanitation, said the health ministry.

There are 2 vaccines for polio -- OPV, which contains live attenuated or weakened poliovirus, and IPV, which does not contain any live poliovirus. Many countries have progressively switched to IPV, and Singapore stopped using OPV in 2021, said MOH.

""Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis is an extremely rare adverse event that occurs when an individual develops paralytic polio after receiving OPV. The risk is higher for immunocompromised persons, for whom IPV is recommended instead of OPV.""

Singapore has not reported any locally acquired cases of polio since 1978. The last polio case reported in 2006 was an imported case, added the ministry.

""Singapore has maintained our polio-free status by continuing high polio vaccination coverage, high standards of environmental hygiene and sanitation, and having an established surveillance system in place to detect possible cases of poliomyelitis.""

Under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS), children receive a total of 5 vaccine doses -- 3 IPV doses for infants at 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months, with another 2 booster doses of IPV at 18 months and 10 to 11 years old, respectively.

""As the IPV does not contain live virus, it carries no risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. Vaccinations in the NCIS are available free to all Singaporean children at Community Health Assist Scheme General Practitioner clinics and polyclinics,"" said the ministry.

University of Wisconsin-Madison's University Health Services (UHS) sent out an email to 4000 students and staff Friday afternoon [7 Feb 2025] regarding a potential hepatitis A exposure linked to campus dining facility Rheta's Market.

UHS identified a case of hepatitis A in a student who worked in food service at Rheta's Market, a dining hall on campus, according to the email sent to possibly affected individuals. The student was infectious while working, prompting the university to contact all campus members who may have visited Rheta's Market during the infectious period and until the facility underwent thorough cleaning by the Environment, Health and Safety team.

Officials have since cleared Rheta's Market to resume normal operations. ""The diagnosed student will not return to work until they are medically cleared,"" UHS Director Jack Baggott said in an email. ""This process is standard and aims to cover a wide net of potential exposures out of an abundance of caution.""

Hepatitis A is a contagious viral liver disease which can be caused by the hepatitis A virus. Symptoms can range from mild illness lasting a few weeks to severe illness persisting for months.

The virus spreads primarily through the ingestion of contaminated food or water or close contact with an infected person. Vaccination is highly effective in preventing infection and is recommended for children, teens and adults who have not previously been vaccinated or infected.

UHS is providing guidance to those potentially exposed and has made 24/7 medical services advice available through the weekend. Students and staff are encouraged to seek additional information on hepatitis A from the CDC or UHS. Students who believe they may have been exposed should monitor for symptoms, including fatigue, nausea, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes) and abdominal pain and seek medical attention if symptoms develop.

<https://srhd.org/news/srhd-reports-pertussis-death-in-spokane-county>


The Spokane Regional Health District (SRHD) announced the first confirmed death from pertussis (whooping cough) in Washington since 2011.

A resident of Spokane County, under the age of 5, passed away in November 2024, and the death was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week. Although pertussis was confirmed as the cause of death, there were other health factors that contributed. The child received some doses of the DTaP vaccine but had not completed the series.

Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable disease that can cause severe coughing fits, which may be especially dangerous for infants, young children, and individuals with compromised immune systems. SRHD urges residents to ensure they and their loved ones are up to date on pertussis vaccinations to help prevent the spread of this deadly disease.

""We are deeply saddened by this loss and extend our condolences to the family,"" said Dr. Francisco Velazquez, health officer for Spokane County. ""This death serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vaccination, especially for those who are most vulnerable, including infants and young children. We encourage all community members to make sure their vaccinations are up to date, as the best way to protect yourself and others from pertussis is through immunization.""

Pertussis is a bacterial infection that causes severe coughing spells, often followed by a ""whooping"" sound when the person inhales. It can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and even death. Infants and young children are particularly at risk, which is why early vaccination is crucial.

To achieve adequate community-wide protection from pertussis, 92%-94% of the population needs to be up to date on their vaccinations. SRHD strongly recommends that all individuals, particularly those who are pregnant or have young children, follow the following vaccination guidelines:
- Infants and young children: DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) vaccines are recommended for children at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and again at 4-6 years.
- Adolescents and adults: A Tdap booster shot is recommended for individuals aged 11-12, and every 10 years thereafter.
- Pregnant women: Expectant mothers should receive the Tdap vaccine during each pregnancy, ideally between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation, to protect their newborns.

Steps to prevent pertussis:
- Ensure you and your family members are up to date on vaccinations. Although vaccinated people may still contract pertussis, there is lower risk of complications.
- Wash hands frequently and cover coughs and sneezes to reduce the spread of respiratory diseases.
- Stay home when sick, especially if you or your child are exhibiting symptoms of pertussis.

SRHD is working closely with local healthcare providers to increase testing of individuals whose signs and symptoms are suggestive of pertussis. They are also ramping up efforts to provide information and resources on vaccination and disease prevention to the community.

For information about vaccinations, including where to get them, please visit <http://srhd.org> and search for ""vaccines."" Local clinics and healthcare providers are available to administer the vaccine to both children and adults.

""We all play a role in keeping our community healthy, and vaccination is one of the most important steps we can take to prevent the spread of pertussis,"" said Velazquez. ""Together, we can protect those who are most vulnerable and prevent further loss of life.""

Measles outbreak detected at a Costa del Sol nursery
----------------------------------------------------
The Junta de Andaluc√≠a's Ministry of Health has activated the surveillance and alert protocol for measles after an outbreak of the disease was detected in a Costa del Sol nursery, the name of which has not yet been revealed. According to sources, the disease has been detected in 3  children. Two of them are twin brothers, 24 months, while the third is 14 months old. As all 3 are from the same day care centre, health officials believe that there has been transmission between them. The nationality of the 3 youngsters is not known at this stage.

The protocol assesses the situation as an outbreak, given that all 3 cases originated in the same nursery. Tests are being carried out in a laboratory, at the same time as an epidemiological investigation is working to detect the possible source. What is confirmed is that none of the 3 children had the MMR vaccine, which protects against the virus.

In the meantime, control measures on cases and contacts are being carried out in accordance with the measles surveillance and alert protocol. Measles is a highly contagious disease and it is therefore essential to quickly establish a contact study to determine both the source of infection and the number of people the case might have infected. ""Contact-tracing will be carried out among all persons that might have been exposed to a suspected case during the contagious period (from 4 days before the onset of the rash to 4 days after, including the day of rash onset),"" states the protocol. In addition, vaccination history will be investigated ""as accurately as possible"".

If the contact study identifies susceptible individuals who are unable or unwilling to receive the vaccine, they will be removed from the environment where the case was confirmed and put under quarantine until the end of the incubation period (up to 23 days since exposure). This step of the protocol is relevant in the present case, as the 3 affected individuals were not vaccinated. These contacts will be monitored for 23 days following their last interaction with a confirmed case.

As the protocol states, what significantly improves the likelihood of preventing the spread of the disease or mitigating the severity, is rapid vaccination (within 72 hours of exposure) of susceptible contacts. ""Vaccination should always be offered to susceptible contacts to prevent measles transmission, especially when there is an outbreak, regardless of the time that has elapsed since exposure, to prevent measles,"" officials have said.

Another outbreak of measles was detected in Spain in January 2025, but this time in the Basque Country. The local health department reported that the disease had been identified in 12 people in the city of Biscay on 16 Jan 2025. According to the El Correo newspaper, another 27 individuals were detected in the following 2 weeks. The outbreak in Biscay has mostly affected ""young adults, between 25-45 years of age, citizens of foreign origin and healthcare workers"". Among those cases are professionals who tended to the first infected people at the Osakidetza health centre. One of the latest cases of infection involved a girl who is a direct relative of one of the cases that had already been identified at the beginning of January 2025. The recovery of all affected individuals is favorable. However, the situation is being closely analysed due to the number of cases.

The Texas Department of State Health Services is reporting an outbreak of measles in Gaines County. At this time, 10 cases have been identified with symptom onset within the last 2 weeks.

Eight of the cases are among school-aged children and 2 cases are under the age of 5. Seven of the patients have been hospitalized. All of the cases are unvaccinated and residents of Gaines County.

Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in Gaines County and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with South Plains Public Health District and Lubbock Public Health to investigate the outbreak.

The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with 2 doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.

Measles alert issued in WA after infected person attends Drake concert in Perth
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drake fans who attended his concert in Perth on Tuesday night [4 Feb 2025] have been put on alert after a person infected with measles attended the performance at RAC Arena. The Department of Health said the confirmed case, the first in WA in 2025, was a returned traveler from Bali who had stopped in at several locations in the city between Sunday [2 Feb 2025] and Friday [7 Feb 2025]. That included a show by Canadian rapper Drake and visits to the 3 Quarters Topped Up Caf√© in East Perth, and the GP After Hours Clinic in Mount Nasura -- all on Tuesday [4 Feb 2025].

""Anyone who has visited an exposure location during the dates and times listed should monitor for symptoms and, if symptomatic, wear a mask and seek medical care,"" Communicable Disease Control director Paul Armstrong said. ""Before presenting at a GP clinic or emergency department, call ahead so staff can ensure you do not infect other patients and staff.""

Fever, tiredness, a cough, and a red non-itchy rash are among symptoms. ""The rash normally starts on the face before spreading down to the body and usually lasts for 4 to 7 days,"" according to the Department of Health. ""Some measles cases involve complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and many people with measles end up in hospital. Measles is highly infectious and can spread via airborne droplets to people close by. Droplets in the air may still infect people entering a room up to 30 minutes after an infected person has left it.

""People with measles are usually infectious from one day before their symptoms start and for 4 days after their rash appears.""

Measles often develops about 10 days after being exposed to the virus, but people who visited exposure sites should monitor for symptoms for 18 days. There is no risk of measles at the named locations outside of the dates and times listed, authorities said.

Authorities said measles was rare in Australia thanks to high vaccinations, but small outbreaks do occur ""generally due to residents or visitors who get infected while overseas.""

Full list of exposure sites:
- Department of Health: Mon 3 Feb 2025, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
- 3 Quarters Topped Up Cafe: Mon 3 Feb 2025, 9 a.m. to 10 a.m.

A rise in cases of measles has hit a rural area in and around Gaines County, in Texas, where the measles vaccination rate is low. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported that there were 6 confirmed cases on Wednesday [5 Feb 2025]. As of Friday [7 Feb 2025], the outbreak had jumped to 14 confirmed cases and 6 probable cases, Zach Holbrooks, the executive director of the South Plains Public Health District, which serves the area, told CNN.

Newsweek has contacted the South Plains Public Health District, via email, for comment.

Measles, an airborne disease, is an extremely infectious illness that can be especially dangerous for infants, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, with the potential to cause serious and even deathly complications. It can spread rapidly in communities with low vaccination rates, and initially results in symptoms including a high fever, a cough, a runny nose, and red or watery eyes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

For the 2023-24 school year, 82% of kindergartners in Gaines County public schools were up to date with their vaccines, according to state data. This is lower than the 95% vaccination rate required for herd immunity, according to the CDC, and makes Gaines County part of the 10 with the lowest vaccine coverage in the state.

The county has an 18% vaccine exemption rate, which ""allows for an exemption from immunizations for reasons of conscience, including a religious belief."" The South Plains Public Health District's Dr. Jamie Felberg said: ""Measles is a serious yet preventable disease. Staying up to date on vaccinations is the most effective way to safeguard yourself, your loved ones, and the community from this highly contagious illness. With these recent cases, it's more important than ever to ensure your immunizations are current.""

Holbrooks told Ars Technica: ""We're trying to get out the message about how important vaccination is.""

In its Friday [7 Feb 2025] alert, the Department of State Health Services wrote that, due to the highly contagious nature of the disease, ""additional cases are likely to occur in Gaines County and the surrounding communities,"" adding that the agency is working with local health officials to investigate the rapid rise.

Fifteen cases of measles reported in small West Texas county with high rate of vaccine exemptions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fifteen measles cases -- mostly in school-aged children -- have been confirmed in a small county in West Texas with one of the highest rates of vaccine exemptions in the state. South Plains Public Health District Director Zach Holbrooks said Monday [10 Feb 2025] that his department was first notified in late January 2025 about the 1st 2 cases in Gaines County, which he said were ""2 children who had seen a physician in Lubbock.""

Some of the cases appear to be connected to private religious schools in the district, said Holbrooks, who cautioned that the investigation is ongoing. ""I wouldn't say they're all connected, but our teams are looking into exposure sites and the background of those cases,"" he said.

Local health officials set up a drive-through vaccination clinic last week and are offering screening services to residents.

The USA saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. This month [February 2025], health officials in metro Atlanta are working to contain a measles case that spread to 2 unvaccinated family members. Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs. The percentage of kids with exemptions has risen over the last decade from 0.76% in 2014 to 2.32% last year [2024], according to Texas Department of State Health Services data.

Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine: Nearly 14% of children from kindergarten through grade 12 had an exemption in the 2023-24 school year, which is more than 5 times the state average of 2.32% and beyond the national rate of 3.3%. But the number of unvaccinated kids in the county is likely significantly higher, DSHS spokeswoman Lara Anton said, because Gaines County has many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported.

The measles, mumps and rubella vaccines is a 2-shot series: The 1st is recommended at 12 to 15 months old and 2nd between 4 to 6 years old. The vaccine is required to attend most public schools in the USA. But vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners -- the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks. Lawmakers across the country have proposed various vaccine requirement changes at a time when anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is awaiting confirmation as the secretary of Health and Human Services.

One of the early Gaines County cases traveled to neighboring New Mexico while they were still infectious, Anton said, but there were no immediate reports of infection. New Mexico health officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Two cases of measles were reported in early January 2025 in the Houston area, but Holbrooks said the West Texas cases don't appear to be connected.

Measles is a highly contagious virus that can survive in the air for up to 2 hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the USA saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it's usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, NCDC, has said that the country continues to grapple with a diphtheria outbreak.

NCDC, via its official website, reported that a total of 41 336 suspected diphtheria cases had been recorded across 36 states and the FCT. The cases were reported from 350 local government areas between Epidemiological Week 19, 2022, and Epidemiological Week 4, 2025.

According to NCDC's latest data, 24 846 cases (60.1%) were confirmed, while 7769 (18.8%) were discarded. The classification of 3546 cases (8.6%) is pending, while the status of 5175 cases (12.5%) remains unknown.

The agency noted that the outbreak is concentrated in a few states, with Kano leading with 23 784 suspected cases, followed by Yobe (5302), Katsina (3708), Bauchi (3066), Borno (2902), Kaduna (777), and Jigawa (364). These 7 states account for 96.5% of all suspected cases.

""Of the confirmed cases, the majority -- 15 845 (63.9%) -- occurred among children aged one to 14 years, highlighting the disease's severe impact on younger populations.

""Alarmingly, only 4963 (20%) of the confirmed cases were fully vaccinated with a diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine, suggesting gaps in vaccination coverage,"" the agency stated.

NCDC reported that the outbreak has resulted in 1262 deaths, reflecting a case fatality rate, CFR, of 5.1% among confirmed cases.

The highest number of confirmed cases was recorded in Kano (17 770), followed by Bauchi (2334), Yobe (2380), Katsina (1088), Borno (1036), Jigawa (53), Plateau (31), and Kaduna (44). These states account for 99.4% of all confirmed cases.

The agency further disclosed that 8 suspected cases were recently recorded in 2 states across 5 local government areas. Six of the cases (75%) were confirmed as clinically compatible with diphtheria. No deaths were recorded in the latest cases, keeping the CFR at 0% for the period.

NCDC stressed the importance of vaccination in combating the disease.

""With the majority of cases occurring in children, strengthening immunisation efforts remains critical.

""Public health campaigns, improved surveillance, and rapid response initiatives are being deployed, particularly in the hardest-hit states,"" it stated.

The General Directorate of Health in Melilla has confirmed several cases of measles at the regional hospital in the Spanish-occupied enclave, according to reports from Spanish media.

Authorities indicated that the infections were detected in recent days among individuals who were not vaccinated against the disease. The cases have been linked to recent travel to Moroccan cities, raising concerns that the virus may have been contracted there.

In response, Melilla‚Äôs health officials have issued a warning about the potential for an outbreak and advised the public to take preventive measures.

15 more measles cases reported in Norfolk County
--------------------------------------------
The measles outbreak continues its spread in southwestern Ontario. On Monday [10 Feb 2025], Grand Erie Public Health announced 15 additional cases in Norfolk County. The total number of infections reported across Haldimand County, Norfolk County, Brantford, and Brant counties now sits at 37; 5 of them are adults and 32 are children. All are recovering at home.

Officials said the new illnesses are all linked to previously reported cases. They also released an updated list of locations where the public may have been exposed to the measles:

- Houghton Public School in Langton - From 3-5 Feb 2025, between 8:30 a.m. and 5:05 p.m.
- Delhi Community Health Centre Walk-In Clinic and Pharmasave - 8 Feb 2025 between 9:00 a.m. and noon
- Walsingham Christian School - 24, 30, 31 Jan 2025 and 3 Feb 2025 between 8:00 a.m. to 5 p.m.
- Norfolk General Hospital in Simcoe - 7 Feb 2025 between 3 p.m. to 5:35 p.m.

Measles is an airborne illness that is also highly contagious. Symptoms include a red, blotchy rash that spreads down the body, fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. Anyone experiencing symptoms is asked not to visit high-risk settings such as doctor's offices, childcare facilities, and hospital emergency rooms, but instead contact their health provider to discuss next steps.

In an update on 29 Jan [2025], Grand Erie Public Health said most of the confirmed measles cases were in unvaccinated or under-vaccinated communities. Many of the children were also students at a private school. Officials said those 2 factors made it much more difficult to track the illness and manage its spread.

10 new cases of measles reported in West Texas county and New Mexico
-------------------------------------------------------------
Public health authorities said Tuesday [11 Feb 2025] that an outbreak of measles in western Texas has expanded, while a new case was confirmed nearby across state lines in New Mexico. The Texas Department of State Health Services has identified 24 measles cases in connection with the onset of symptoms within the last 2 weeks. Gaines County, a small county in West Texas, has one of the highest rates of vaccine exemptions in the state.

In neighboring Lea County, New Mexico, residents were alerted Tuesday to the measles infection of an unvaccinated teenager, as well as the possible exposure of more people in Lovington at a hospital emergency room and sixth grade school gymnasium.

""The New Mexico youth had no recent travel or exposure to known cases from the Texas outbreak,"" the New Mexico Department of Health said in a news release.

Nine of the measles patients in Texas have been hospitalized. All of the confirmed cases in Gaines County involve unvaccinated residents.

Measles is a highly contagious virus that can survive in the air for up to 2 hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the USA saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it's usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.

Local health officials in Gaines County set up a drive-through vaccination clinic last week and are offering screening services to residents. The New Mexico Department of Health announced a no-appointment vaccination clinics in Hobbs, starting next week.

The USA saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60 [in unimmunized immigrants - Mod.LL].

Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs. The percentage of kids with exemptions has risen over the last decade from 0.76% in 2014 to 2.32% last year [2024], according to Texas Department of State Health Services data.

The Departmental Health Service (Sedes) reported the death of a 1-month-old child and 64 cases of pertussis (whooping cough) so far this year [2025] in the department of Santa Cruz.

""During 2025, we have had 168 suspected cases of pertussis and 64 positive cases. Some children were treated in health centers and others in hospitals; they underwent outpatient treatment, reacting favorably and are in good health,"" reported the director of Sedes, Jaime Bilbao, at a press conference.

Of these cases, 4 minors were hospitalized and one died.

""In the fifth epidemiological week, a girl under 1 month of age died at the Children's Hospital, referred from a private clinic. She arrived in poor condition and unfortunately died,"" Bilbao explained.

The same week, a girl under 1 year of age was hospitalized and recovered satisfactorily and was discharged. To date, there are 2 girls admitted to the Children's Hospital, who are medicated with favorable progress.

Bilbao recommended that parents take their children to health facilities to receive the vaccine against this disease, which is ""highly"" contagious. He advised that adults who have a respiratory infection stay away from babies and children.

The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health has confirmed the detection of the second wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case of 2025.

On Wednesday [12 Feb 2025], the lab confirmed one polio case from District Badin, Sindh.

The first case of the year [2025] was reported from DI Khan district in South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Last year in 2024, a total of 74 cases were reported. Of these, 27 were from Balochistan, 22 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 23 from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Islamabad.

Polio is a paralyzing disease that has no cure. Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of 5 is essential to provide children high immunity against this terrible disease.

The Pakistan Polio Program conducts multiple mass vaccination drives in a year, bringing the vaccine to children at their doorsteps, while the Expanded Program on Immunization provides vaccinations against 12 childhood disease free of charge at health facilities. It is crucial for parents to ensure vaccination for all their children under the age of 5 to keep them protected.

The first nationwide polio campaign of 2025 has been successfully concluded, with 99% of the targets achieved across the country. The campaign was conducted from 3 to 9 Feb 2025.

During this campaign, more than 45 million children were administered the polio vaccine.

In every campaign, the program ensures that children under 5 years receive polio drops, to protect them from the crippling effects of the polio virus.

The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is reporting an outbreak of measles in the South Plains region of Texas. At this time, 48 cases have been identified with symptom onset within the last 3 weeks. Thirteen of the patients have been hospitalized. All of the cases are unvaccinated or their vaccination status is unknown. Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in Gaines County and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with South Plains Public Health District and Lubbock Public Health to investigate the outbreak.

The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with 2 doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles. Residents of the South Plains can go to the South Plains Public Health District Clinic at 704 Hobbs Highway in Seminole to get vaccinated.

USA records most whooping cough deaths since 2017
-------------------------------------------------
The USA confirmed at least a dozen deaths from whooping cough in 2024, according to preliminary figures released this week by the CDC. That marks the most fatalities from the bacterial infection since a 2017 surge of the illness, which is also known as pertussis. Over the last month, pertussis infections have been rising again. While cases reported to the CDC by health departments dipped over the winter holidays, weekly infections have accelerated for a month straight since then.

At least 360 pertussis cases were reported nationwide in last week's update to the CDC's tally of infections. Cases are up 27% from the week before. Weekly cases peaked at 577 late in 2024, before plummeting to less than 200 over the New Year's holiday.

Florida reported 44 cases last week, the most of any state. That displaces Ohio, which had been the state with the most pertussis infections for many recent weeks. Cases have been reported in counties throughout Florida, according to data from the state's health department, with the largest tallies around Miami and Tampa. Similar to other states, most cases reported in Florida have been in children under 5 years old. More than a third of whooping cough cases have been in older kids.

""People of all ages are at risk for getting pertussis (whooping cough). Everyone who is not up to date with whooping cough vaccination should get vaccinated,"" CDC spokesperson Paul Prince said in a statement.

Whooping cough can initially be difficult to separate from other cold-causing germs that surge over the colder months. Pertussis infections are called whooping cough because of the sound of severe coughing attacks, which can linger for weeks. Some people are at higher risk of life-threatening complications from whooping cough infections, including babies and people who are not up to date on their vaccines. Prince, the CDC spokesperson, said data on pertussis deaths for January 2025 was not available. Whooping cough deaths can take several weeks to be confirmed. 

A local health department earlier in February 2025 in Washington announced the first whooping cough death in the state since 2011. A 5-year-old had died in November 2024, but was only confirmed as a pertussis death by the CDC in recent weeks. The child had not completed the pertussis vaccine series, the Spokane Regional Health District said in a release, and also had ""other health factors that contributed"" to their death. ""This death serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vaccination, especially for those who are most vulnerable, including infants and young children,"" Dr. Francisco Velazquez, the county's health officer, said in a statement.

Officials have warned for months that the USA was likely on track to see a major wave in whooping cough cases. While infections usually climb every 3 to 5 years, pertussis was among many germs that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other changes have also driven up pertussis cases in recent years, including a change in 2020 intended to cut down on missed cases by epidemiologists and waning immunity from pertussis vaccines.

""We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments. Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment,"" said Dr. Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami. He said it had been many years since they had seen a major outbreak of pertussis infections, as opposed to ""little pockets of increases"" around their system. 

Mestre said older pertussis patients often come into the emergency room after facing a persistent cough that does not go away after a week or so. Younger babies come in to get evaluated sooner and are at higher risk. ""They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness,"" said Mestre.

Caregivers are urged to get up to date on their vaccines because that can reduce the risk of passing on an infection to young children, Mestre said. Pregnant moms who get vaccinated also pass on immunity to their children, protecting them as soon as they are born. ""It's important that people understand that immunity wanes, even if you are vaccinated as a child. And if you are going to be around infants, we recommend vaccination every 10 years,"" he said.

Measles in Ontario
---------------
Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus. Symptoms of measles include fever, a red blotchy rash, red watery eyes, and cough. Immunization is the best protection against measles. For children and most adults born in or after 1970, this means receiving 2 doses of measles containing-vaccine (e.g., MMR vaccine).

In Ontario, measles has been rare, owing to the successful elimination of measles in Canada and high immunization coverage. As a result, measles cases have typically been predominantly associated with travel (often referred to as ""measles importations""). Due to an increase in measles activity globally in 2024, Ontario began to see more cases of measles. Presently, Ontario is experiencing a multi-jurisdictional measles outbreak that has included cases from New Brunswick and Manitoba.

Highlights:
- In 2025, a total of 57 confirmed and 6 probable cases of measles have been reported in Ontario as of 12 February. Most of these cases were associated with an ongoing multi-jurisdictional outbreak. One confirmed case in 2025 was associated with travel (i.e., acquired measles outside of Canada); this case was an unimmunized child who required hospitalization.

- Laboratory data as of 11 Feb [2025] indicates 19.0% of individuals (n=32) who have undergone laboratory testing for acute measles infection using molecular PCR in 2025 have tested positive.

Multi-jurisdictional measles outbreak
- On 18 Oct 2024, exposure to a travel-related case in New Brunswick led to outbreaks of measles in New Brunswick and Ontario. While New Brunswick declared their outbreak over on 7 Jan 2025, Ontario continues to experience measles transmission, which has also led to cases of measles in Manitoba.

- As of 12 Feb 2025 [starting on 28 Oct 2024], 99 cases of measles (67 confirmed, 32 probable) have been reported in Ontario in association with this outbreak; this reflects an increase of 41 confirmed cases and 5 probable cases since the previous epidemiological summary on 30 Jan 2025 (Figure 1 [for tables and figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). Overall, laboratory confirmation was available for 34 cases.

Outbreak cases have occurred in 4 public health units: Southwestern Public Health, Grey Bruce Health Unit, Grand Erie Public Health [formerly Brant County Health Unit and Haldimand Norfolk Health Unit], and Chatham-Kent Public Health (Table 1).
- All outbreak cases were in individuals born in or after 1970; 84 were in children and adolescents, and 15 in adults (Table 1).
- Among children and adolescents, 98.8% were unimmunized (Figure 2).
- Seven outbreak cases have required hospitalization (Table 1), and all were unimmunized children.

New Mexico health department reports 2 more measles cases in Lea County
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) reports 2 adult Lea County residents tested positive for measles Thursday [13 Feb 2025], as confirmed by the NMDOH Scientific Laboratory Division, totaling to 3 cases this week.

New Mexico meets the CDC's outbreak criteria with 3 unrelated cases in Lea County. The cases border Texas's Gaines County, where cases have jumped from 2 to 48 cases in 2 weeks. While a connection to the Texas outbreak is suspected, it remains unconfirmed.

""We are investigating every suspected case, and we encourage sick individuals with symptoms consistent with measles to seek medical care,"" said Dr. Chad Smelser, NMDOH deputy state epidemiologist.

NMDOH is notifying potentially exposed individuals and providing prevention guidance. If you visited these locations during specified times, you may have been exposed:

- Stone Elementary School, Hobbs, NM, on Thu 6 Feb 2025
- Albertsons grocery store, 2402 N. Grimes St., Hobbs, NM, between the hours of 1 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. on Thu 6 Feb 2025
- Albertsons grocery store, 2402 N. Grimes St., Hobbs, NM, between the hours of 1 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. on Sat 8 Feb 2025
- Crosswinds Community Church, 1701 N Jefferson St., Hobbs, NM, between the hours of 9 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. on Sun 9 Feb 2025
- Walgreens, 801 Joe Harvey Blvd, Hobbs, NM, between the hours of 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Sun 9 Feb 2025
- Nor-Lea Hospital emergency department between the hours of 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Mon 10 Feb 2025
- Nor-Lea Hospital extended hours clinic, 1923 N Dal Paso, Hobbs, NM, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Mon 10 Feb 2025
- Nor-Lea Hospital emergency department between the hours of 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. on Tue 11 Feb 2025.

If you were at these locations during the listed times, monitor for symptoms. If symptoms develop, isolate, and call your healthcare provider and inform them of possible measles exposure before visiting. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine works very well, making it far less likely for you to get measles than someone unvaccinated with no immunity. Those born before 1957 are already immune.

Vaccination provides strong protection; however, if you are vaccinated and develop symptoms after exposure, consult a healthcare provider. Most adults vaccinated as children are presumed to be immune.

Measles exposure risk at NJ hospital, health officials warn
-----------------------------------------------------
The New Jersey Department of Health warned residents Friday [14 Feb 2025] that a person with measles recently visited the emergency department at Englewood Hospital in Bergen County. The department said the person, who had recently traveled internationally, visited the hospital on 9 Feb [2025] between 11:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.

Anyone who was at the hospital at that time may have been exposed and was asked to contact a doctor as soon as possible to discuss potential exposure and risk of developing the illness, according to a release from the department. The virus spreads easily through the air when someone coughs or sneezes and can remain in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person leaves the area, officials said. People can also get sick when they come in contact with mucus or saliva from an infected person. The department stressed people should call their doctor first before arriving at any facility so that necessary infection prevention precautions can be taken to protect other patients and staff.

Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery red eyes, and a rash that usually appears between 3 and 5 days after symptoms begin, health officials said. The rash usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, authorities said. Measles can also cause serious complications, such as pneumonia and encephalitis and can lead to miscarriage in pregnant people, premature birth, or a low-birth-weight baby.

People at risk include those who have not been fully vaccinated or have not had measles in the past, the department said. Anyone who was potentially exposed and infected could develop symptoms as late as 6 Mar [2025], officials said.

As of Friday [14 Feb 2025] investigators had not identified any additional associated cases.

Hepatitis A alert issued for Manhattan restaurant
--------------------------------------------
The New York City Health Department has issued a public health advisory after confirming a case of hepatitis A in a food handler at ilili Restaurant on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The department is taking preventive measures, though no additional cases have been reported.

Health officials are advising customers who dined at or ordered takeout from ilili between 31 Jan 2025 and 9 Feb 2025 to receive a hepatitis A vaccination if they haven't previously been immunized. Those who consumed food from the restaurant between 17 Jan and 9 Feb 2025 are advised to monitor for symptoms for 7 weeks after their exposure.

In a press release, acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said, ""We are urging these restaurant patrons to consult with their providers and get the hepatitis A vaccine as a precautionary measure. If people experience symptoms like yellowing of eyes and skin, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea, they should see a doctor immediately, especially if you have not had 2 doses of the hepatitis A vaccine. This incident serves as an important reminder to stay up to date with current vaccination recommendations, and to always wash your hands thoroughly to prevent the spread of disease.""

The viral liver infection can spread through food handled by an infected person. For maximum effectiveness, the vaccine should be administered within 14 days of exposure. Some people may require an additional dose of immune globulin, depending on their age and health status. Patrons who have previously received 2 vaccine doses or have had hepatitis A infection don't need additional vaccination, while those with only one previous dose should complete the series.

Hepatitis A transmission occurs when traces of fecal matter from an infected person contaminate items that others put in their mouths. The disease has no specific treatment once symptoms appear. Individuals at highest risk for severe infection include those with chronic liver disease, compromised immune systems, and pregnant people. Though rarely fatal, affecting less than 1% of cases, the disease is highly contagious. Those potentially exposed are encouraged to consult their healthcare providers about vaccination options. Vaccination locations can be found through the NYC Health Map.

Chad officials seal schools as measles epidemic hits poor district
------------------------------------------------------------
Chad health officials have sealed several dozen schools, sent thousands of children and their teachers home, and restricted movements to and from the Bologo district -- 400 km [249 mi] south of the capital, N'djamena -- to contain a measles epidemic. Officials blame vaccine hesitancy for the rapid measles spread within the past 2 weeks.

State TV reports that thousands of children in Chad's Bologo district have been ordered to stay home for a week as their schools remain closed to prevent measles from spreading. Many churches and mosques in the district are closed too.

About 50 cases of measles were confirmed within the past 2 weeks, said Oumar Mahamat Traore, chief health official in Bologo, appointed by Chad's central government in N'djamena. He said the situation is very concerning because all 7 of the hospitals in Bologo district have at least 5 children receiving treatment for measles. He said parents should make sure all children having high fever, runny nose, red and watery eyes, and rashes on their faces and bodies accompanied by small white spots inside the mouth are immediately rushed to the nearest hospital, where they will receive free treatment.

Traore spoke to VOA by telephone. He said it is difficult to know the number of children affected by the measles epidemic because more than 80% of civilians in Bologo prefer African traditional medicine and go to conventional hospitals only in critical circumstances. Hospitals have not reported any deaths, but some affected children are in critical condition, according to government officials.

Chad's government said health workers have been dispatched to Bologo and surrounding towns and villages to educate civilians against popular beliefs that the viral disease is divine punishment for wrongdoing and can be treated only by offering traditional sacrifices to the gods.

Health workers are raising awareness that measles can be treated with conventional medicine.

The UN reports that measles is one of the main causes of death among children in Chad. Outbreaks occur often because vaccination coverage remains low throughout the central African state. Chad's Health Ministry says vaccine hesitancy is to blame for millions of children not being inoculated against childhood diseases including measles.

In 2023, Doctors Without Borders reported that more than 1.3 million children between the ages of 6 months and 10 years old were inoculated against measles. Chad said there were plans with its international partners to inoculate at least 4 million children in the country of close to 18 million people. But armed conflicts, and tensions triggered by elections to end a 3-year transition that followed the death of President Idriss Deby Itno in 2021, made it impossible for humanitarian agencies to continue vaccination drives. Officials hope that with peace returning and constitutional order reestablished -- with the election of Mahamat Idriss Deby as president and the new parliament -- more vaccine campaigns will be organized.

Measles is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory system that can lead to severe complications and death. The UN says it is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. In the absence of specific treatment, vaccination is the most effective medical tool against measles, the World Health Organization said. The vaccine is safe, effective, and inexpensive, according to the UN.

Officials confirm measles case in BC's Lower Mainland
-----------------------------------------------
Officials are warning travelers they may have been exposed to measles after an infected individual returned to BC from Southeast Asia. The infected person lives in the Fraser Health region, which stretches from Burnaby to Hope, and arrived in Vancouver on Tue 11 Feb [2025], according to a joint statement issued Saturday [15 Feb 2025] by the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health authorities.

Anyone who was aboard Air Canada Flight 66 from Bangkok to Vancouver that day may have been exposed to measles, as well as anyone who spent time in the international arrivals area of YVR between 7 a.m. and 9:30 a.m., officials said.

""Measles is a highly infectious disease transmitted by airborne spread,"" the notice reads. ""Most people in Canada will be immune to measles due to prior immunization or natural infection.""

Officials recommended anyone who has not been previously infected or received 2 doses of the measles vaccine and may have been exposed to get a booster, if born in 1970 or later. Those born before 1970 are assumed to have natural immunity. Those who can't be vaccinated such as infants and pregnant people are asked to call a health-care provider for advice.

The health authorities asked anyone who may have been exposed to monitor for measles symptoms, which could take up to 3 weeks to develop. Those include a fever, dry cough, runny nose, and red eyes followed by a rash that starts at the hairline and spreads.

""If you develop symptoms of measles, please contact your health-care provider before you visit them so they can take precautions to prevent spreading measles to others,"" the notice reads.

The health authorities added they are following up with people who were confirmed to be exposed.

UKHSA issues warning as Bristol has highest levels of 'serious' infection
-------------------------------------------------------------
The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) South West and Bristol City Council are urging parents across Bristol to look out for the signs and symptoms of measles and check their children's MMR vaccination status this half term. The message comes as data published by UKHSA shows that Bristol has had the highest number of confirmed measles cases so far this year [2025] out of all upper tier local authorities in the country.

Measles -- described as a ""highly contagious, serious airborne disease"" by the WHO -- has been circulating across the South West region for several months, but this more rapid rise in cases within the region is worrying, UKHSA said. The number of cases in Bristol so far in 2025 is already nearly half of the total number of cases the city had in 2024 (25 in 2025 compared to 53 in 2024).

Dr Toyin Ejidokun, consultant in health protection at UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) South West, said: ""Measles is highly infectious, and it can cause serious disease or even death in some rare cases. This half term, we are urging parents to remain alert to the symptoms of measles, which can include cold-like symptoms, sore red eyes, a high temperature, or a red-brown blotchy rash.

""If you experience these symptoms, seek medical attention, but please ensure that you phone ahead before visiting a healthcare setting, such as your GP surgery, so that arrangements can be made to prevent others from being infected.""

Julie Northcott, deputy director of Public Health at Bristol City Council, said: ""Measles spreads very easily and quickly amongst those who are unvaccinated. One person infected by measles can infect 9 out of 10 of their unvaccinated close contacts.

""The MMR vaccine is safe and by far the most effective way to protect yourself and those around you. Approximately 14.9% of 5-year-old children in Bristol have not had the MMR vaccination and so are currently not protected. It's never too late to have the vaccine, so if you've not received 2 doses of the vaccine in the past -- or you're unsure -- speak to your GP.""

<https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-new-mexico-mmr-outbreak-vaccines-408371700e3ab548777bf0354e586549>


The measles outbreak in rural West Texas has grown to 58 cases as of Tuesday [18 Feb 2025], and 8 people in neighboring eastern New Mexico also have been diagnosed with measles. New Mexico health department spokesman Robert Nott said Tuesday that the agency hadn't ""identified any direct contact"" between cases in its state and cases in Texas.

Measles is a highly contagious disease. Here's what you should know about how to protect yourself against measles, as well as what's happening in Texas and New Mexico.

Where are measles spreading currently?
The West Texas cases are concentrated in Gaines County, which has 45 infections. Terry County to the north has 9 confirmed cases, while Lubbock and Lynn counties have a case each and Yoakum County has 2. The Texas Department of State Health Services said Monday [17 Feb 2025] that 13 people are hospitalized with measles.

State health officials say this outbreak is Texas' largest in nearly 30 years. Health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said last week that cases have been concentrated in a ""close-knit, undervaccinated"" Mennonite community -- especially among families who attend small private religious schools or are homeschooled.

The New Mexico cases are in Lea County, which borders Gaines County in Texas. The cases include a family of 6 that is in isolation, the state health department said Tuesday [18 Feb 2025], but none of those infected have needed to be hospitalized. Six people who have measles are not vaccinated, officials said.

New Mexico officials also said people may have been exposed at a grocery store, an elementary school, a church, Nor-Lea Hospital and a Walgreens in Hobbs.

What is measles?
Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to 2 hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most kids will recover from the measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.

Is the vaccine safe?
Yes, the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective in preventing measles infection and severe cases of the disease. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the United States saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it's usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.

There is no link between the vaccine and autism, despite a now-discredited study and health disinformation.

Why do vaccination rates matter?
In communities with high vaccination rates -- above 95% -- diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called ""herd immunity."" But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots. The United States saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. Five years earlier, measles cases were the worst in almost 3 decades in 2019.

Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials say that number is likely higher because it doesn't include many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported.

What are public health officials doing to stop the spread?
Health workers are hosting regular vaccination clinic and screening efforts in Texas. They are also working with schools to educate people about the importance of vaccination and offering shots.

New Mexico medical providers are being urged to watch for and report measles infections, while state health authorities are attempting to trace and notify people who may have been exposed. The state health department is also doing free vaccination clinics in Hobbs and Lovington this week.

Whooping cough outbreak in Urrao already leaves 4 dead in 2025
--------------------------------------------------------------
The authorities of the municipality of Urrao gave an updated report on the pertussis (whooping cough) outbreak that has been on high alert for the department's health agencies since the end of 2024. According to data from the Urrao Health Secretariat, the number of fatalities from this disease already amounts to 4 people so far in 2025. For this reason, both the local government, the Antioquia Health Secretariat and the municipal hospital announced that they are tightening controls to vaccinate as many children as possible from indigenous communities, a population that is bearing the brunt of the outbreak.

NÃ©stor Aguirre, Secretary of Health of Urrao, recalled that the municipality has 31 communities divided into 3 reservations, on which at least 8 health teams have been deployed that have been carrying out prevention and vaccination work. ""Our indigenous children have difficulties with the vaccination schedules, because they are very distant communities, between one and the other there can be between 1 and 6 hours of distance. To reach them we can be talking about a day or 2 days of travel, according to the climatic conditions and the environments in which they move,"" said the official, specifying that in addition to the distances, the arrival of medical specialists to the communities is hindered by the complex geography of the territory, full of mountains and rivers that are difficult to cross.

As a result of the mobility of indigenous communities, the secretary pointed out that vaccination work has been difficult. ""Brigades are formed, personnel attend, but we also add to this that some of them have no interest in this vaccination. Work has been done with leaders since last year [2024], seeking access to these services, so that they increasingly commit to vaccination,"" Aguirre added.

For its part, the Antioquia Health Secretariat pointed out that thanks to the brigades carried out since last December 2024, more than 300 people have already been vaccinated and an epidemiological fence has been established that has managed to reduce the spread of this respiratory disease. However, that agency indicated that new cases continue to be reported, especially in the community of MajorÃ©. ""The spread of the disease has decreased thanks to prevention and control actions, but the constant mobility and migration of the indigenous people has not allowed the closure of whooping cough in the area, since cases have been reported in another rural area of Urrao known as MajorÃ©.""

At the beginning of February 2025 there were 3 deaths of minors in the community whose causes are being investigated, which motivated the new deployment of an interdisciplinary team to continue the investigations and carry out containment actions,"" said that agency in a statement. The Health Section took the opportunity to reiterate its call to communities to get vaccinated, especially in the case of children under 5 years of age, remembering that in the municipality there are stocks of vaccines for everyone.

Meanwhile, from the municipal hospital, care nurse MÃ³nica HernÃ¡ndez recalled that the medical staff is alert to any case and ready to comply with the protocols in conjunction with the Government and the EPS Savia Salud, which even include helicopter transfers for the most serious cases.

""The hospital, together with the Mayor's Office, the Government and Savia Salud, which is the one with the greatest coverage in the jungle, has strengthened some processes to enter the jungle communities, both the Valle de PÃ©rdidas reservation, the AndabÃº reservation, MajorÃ© and surrounding communities, to evaluate the cases of minors who have been presenting with the current whooping cough outbreak. Our staff is attentive to any eventuality that may arise with the outbreak, to refer patients appropriately,"" the nurse said.

Infant tests positive for measles: first case confirmed in Odessa
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Ector County Health Department has confirmed the first case of measles in the county. The case involves an infant too young to receive the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Public health officials and medical providers are working to identify individuals who may have been exposed to the virus.

Given the highly contagious nature of measles, health officials say additional cases are likely, particularly among unvaccinated individuals. Measles spreads through respiratory droplets and can remain infectious in the air for up to 2 hours. Symptoms typically begin with fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes, followed by a red rash that appears several days later. The virus is contagious for 4 days before the rash appears and up to 4 days afterward.

The Health Department is urging unvaccinated individuals over the age of one to consider receiving the MMR vaccine. According to the CDC, 2 doses of the vaccine provide 97% protection against the virus. Fully vaccinated individuals are unlikely to contract measles.

Health officials emphasize that measles can lead to severe complications, especially in young children. Anyone who has been exposed to the virus or is experiencing symptoms should stay home and contact their healthcare provider for guidance on testing and treatment.

Vaccination efforts increased in parts of Ontario as measles outbreaks grow
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ontario's Ministry of Health is asking some health units in the province to accelerate and expand administering measles vaccines as outbreaks continue to grow. The areas in question are in the southwest where 92 cases of measles have been confirmed since January 2025, many in children and almost all in unvaccinated people.

Southwestern Public Health (SWPH), which includes Oxford and Elgin counties has 35 cases, and Grand Erie Public Health (GEPH), which covers Haldimand, Norfolk and Brant counties, is counting 57 cases. ""Measles is in our community. So if you are not fully up to date on your vaccinations against measles, you are at risk,"" said Dr. Ninh Tran, SWPH's Medical Officer of Health.

The update came in a briefing held by both health units, in which Tran and GEPH's Medical Officer of Health Dr. Malcolm Lock urged community members to stay home if their children or themselves are infected. They also stressed the importance of vaccination. ""Measles is not a new or novel illness. It's been around for decades and for a period of time we thought in Canada we had predominantly eliminated measles,"" Tran said. ""It certainly resurfaced within our region, but there are things that we can do.""

In GEPH's region, 48 cases appeared in children and 9 cases affected adults. The cases are concentrated in the Haldimand-Norfolk area, although Lock did not provide the names of exact communities or locations. In SWPH's area, the majority of cases are in children and are localized close to SWPH's border with GEPH, Tran said.

Across the board, both doctors said, cases were primarily found in unvaccinated people. ""As we're seeing, any small decline in vaccine coverage can lead to a significant amount of measles circulation,"" Tran said.

In response to the growing outbreaks, Lock said, Ontario's Ministry of Health and Public Health Ontario advised both SWPH and GEPH to make immediate changes to their measles vaccination schedules. ""That includes expanded eligibility for infants 6 months to 11 months of age, accelerated schedule for 2nd doses in children under 4 years of age, and 2nd dose for adults born in and after 1970,"" Lock said.

Vaccines that protect against measles are being offered by primary care providers or through community clinics being offered by the health units, Lock added. For weeks, both health units have been providing periodic updates on the spread of the virus in their regions. Those updates have often come in the form of notices to the public including times and dates where locals may have been exposed to the virus.

According to Lock, when a child with symptoms is reported an investigation begins. Since the incubation period for measles is roughly 21 days, children who have had contact with the infected child are pulled from school for 21 days. ""Basically to ensure, if they are incubating anything, that it's not transmitted to other children in the same area,"" Lock said.

In terms of what to do if infected, officials say it's imperative to stay home unless it's absolutely necessary to seek medical attention. If seeking medical attention, it's important to wear a medical grade mask, call ahead to the clinic or hospital, and take other precautions to reduce the risk of spreading the highly contagious disease. Both GEPH and SWPH have webpages. They encourage locals to visit to stay up to date on possible exposure sites and learn more about immunization opportunities. Anyone born in or after 1970 is encouraged to get vaccinated if they haven't done so yet.

[This outbreak of measles as well as the one primarily in southwest Texas continue to increase. Measles is not, and never was, a benign illness.

- Hospitalization: About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people in the United States who gets measles is hospitalized.
- Pneumonia: As many as 1 out of every 20 children with measles gets pneumonia, the most common cause of death from measles in young children.
- Encephalitis: About 1 child out of every 1000 who get measles will develop encephalitis that can lead to convulsions and can leave the child deaf or with intellectual disability.
- Death: Nearly 1 to 3 of every 1000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications.
- Complications during pregnancy: Measles may cause pregnant women who have not had the MMR vaccine to give birth prematurely or have a low-birth-weight baby.

Universal immunization against measles is the best way of preventing the morbidity and mortality of measles. For families buying into the anti-vaccine movement, caveat emptor, buyer beware. 

The following is still pertinent today (<https://fs.blog/roald-dahl-letter-daughter/>):
Roald Dahl, the beloved author of my personal favorites Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda and The BFG, lost his eldest daughter, Olivia, to measles in the early 60s. It wasn't until 1988, however, that he penned a remarkable letter that doubles as a plea to parents, urging them to have their children vaccinated.

The letter is as relevant today as when it originally appeared, in a pamphlet published by the Sandwell Health Authority, in 1988.

Olivia, my eldest daughter, caught measles when she was 7 years old. As the illness took its usual course I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it. Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn't do anything.

""Are you feeling all right?"" I asked her.

""I feel all sleepy,"" she said.

In an hour, she was unconscious. In 12 hours she was dead.

The measles had turned into a terrible thing called measles encephalitis and there was nothing the doctors could do to save her. That was 24 years ago in 1962, but even now, if a child with measles happens to develop the same deadly reaction from measles as Olivia did, there would still be nothing the doctors could do to help her.

On the other hand, there is today something that parents can do to make sure that this sort of tragedy does not happen to a child of theirs. They can insist that their child is immunized against measles. I was unable to do that for Olivia in 1962 because in those days a reliable measles vaccine had not been discovered. Today a good and safe vaccine is available to every family and all you have to do is to ask your doctor to administer it.

It is not yet generally accepted that measles can be a dangerous illness. Believe me, it is. In my opinion, parents who now refuse to have their children immunized are putting the lives of those children at risk. In America, where measles immunization is compulsory, measles like smallpox, has been virtually wiped out.

Here in Britain, because so many parents refuse, either out of obstinacy or ignorance or fear, to allow their children to be immunized, we still have a 100 000 cases of measles every year. Out of those, more than 10 000 will suffer side effects of one kind or another. At least 10 000 will develop ear or chest infections. About 20 will die.

LET THAT SINK IN.

Every year around 20 children will die in Britain from measles.

So what about the risks that your children will run from being immunized?

They are almost non-existent. Listen to this. In a district of around 300 000 people, there will be only one child every 250 years who will develop serious side effects from measles immunization! That is about a million to one chance. I should think there would be more chance of your child choking to death on a chocolate bar than of becoming seriously ill from a measles immunization.

So what on earth are you worrying about? It really is almost a crime to allow your child to go unimmunized.

The ideal time to have it done is at 13 months, but it is never too late. All school-children who have not yet had a measles immunization should beg their parents to arrange for them to have one as soon as possible.

Incidentally, I dedicated 2 of my books to Olivia, the first was 'James and the Giant Peach'. That was when she was still alive. The second was 'The BFG', dedicated to her memory after she had died from measles. You will see her name at the beginning of each of these books. And I know how happy she would be if only she could know that her death had helped to save a good deal of illness and death among other children.

Second case of measles related to Air Canada flight last week confirmed in B.C.'s Lower Mainland
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another case of measles has been confirmed in BC in a Lower Mainland resident who recently traveled to southeast Asia. This comes just days after the 1st case was confirmed by the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health authorities on Saturday [15 Feb 2025]. A statement from Vancouver Coastal Health said members of the public may have been exposed to the virus if they were on Air Canada Flight 66 arriving on 11 Feb 2025 or in the international arrivals area of Vancouver International Airport between 7 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. that day. 

Measles is a highly contagious disease that is spread through direct contact with droplets or via airborne spread. Symptoms include fever, dry cough, runny nose, red eyes and rash, Vancouver Coastal Health said.

Most people in Canada are immune to measles due to prior immunization or natural infection, but anyone who does not have that protection and may have been exposed should get a free booster dose of the measles vaccine. Almost one year ago to the day, BC reported its 1st case of measles since 2019. That case was also related to travel.

The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is reporting an outbreak of measles in the South Plains region of Texas. At this time, 90 cases have been identified since late January 2025. Sixteen of the patients have been hospitalized. Five of the cases are vaccinated. The rest are unvaccinated, or their vaccination status is unknown. Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak.

We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays if there are new cases to report.

County / No. of Cases
---------------------
Dawson / 6
Ector / 1
Gaines / 57
Lubbock / 1
Lynn / 1
Terry / 20
Yoakum / 4

Total: 90

Age Ranges of Measles Cases
---------------------------
0-4 years: 26
5-17 years: 51
18+ years: 10
Pending: 3

The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with 2 doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.

People can contact their health care provider to get vaccinated or visit the South Plains Public Health District Clinic at 704 Hobbs Highway in Seminole to get vaccinated.

The Dallam-Hartley Counties Hospital District (DHCHD) has issued a health advisory regarding suspected measles cases in the community [Dalhart, TX]. DHCHD says several individuals have presented symptoms consistent with measles, and laboratory tests are underway to confirm the diagnoses. As measles is highly contagious, DHCHD urges the community to be aware of the symptoms and seek medical attention if they expect exposure.

This comes after a recent measles outbreak in the South Plains. Nearly 60 cases have been confirmed [now 90, see section above - Mod.LL] across Lubbock, Gaines, Lynn, Terry and Yoakum counties.

Health officials state vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles. DHCHD says the medical team is closely monitoring the situation and are collaborating with local health authorities to ensure swift containment and proper care for those affected.

Health officials at New Mexico Junior College (NMJC) have confirmed a case of measles among one of their students, marking the latest incident in a wave of outbreaks impacting parts of New Mexico and West Texas. The students and individuals who may have had contact with them have been notified, and health services are urging the campus community to remain vigilant.

The outbreak in New Mexico is part of a broader regional surge in measles cases. Across the border in West Texas, the Ector County Health Department recently confirmed its first case involving an infant too young for the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Health officials are tracking possible exposures due to the virus's airborne transmission, which can linger in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person leaves an area.

At the beginning of February [2025], all the alarms went off in a daycare center in M√°laga when it was detected that several children were infected with measles. Now, more than 10 days later, the number of confirmed cases amounts to 8, according to sources consulted by this newspaper.

The first cases of measles were detected on February 5 [2025], 2 of them suspected and 1 confirmed. The infected children were two 2-year-old twins and one 14-month-old boy, not vaccinated with MMR.

As a result, as there were 3 cases detected in the same daycare center, the Andalucian Government declared it a measles outbreak. Since then, 5 more cases associated with this outbreak have been confirmed.

It should be remembered that from the moment the measles outbreak was declared, the Junta de Andaluc√≠a is carrying out the epidemiological investigation of the cases to detect the possible source of the cases, and the control measures on the cases and contacts contemplated in the measles surveillance and alert protocol are being carried out.

This protocol explains that ""measles is very contagious, so it is essential to quickly establish a contact study to determine both the source of infection of the case and to identify the people the case could have infected.""

Therefore, if the contact study identifies susceptible people who cannot or do not want to receive the vaccine, their exclusion from the environment where the case occurred will be established, until the incubation period ends (up to 23 days from exposure). Additionally, these contacts must be followed up for 23 days after the last contact with a confirmed case.

At the same time, they emphasize that preventing the spread of measles depends on the rapid vaccination of susceptible contacts. Vaccination of contacts of a measles case will be carried out as soon as possible.

Likewise, they emphasize that vaccination in the first 72 hours after exposure improves the probability of preventing the disease or mitigating its severity, but vaccination should always be offered to susceptible contacts, regardless of the time elapsed since exposure, to prevent measles transmission, especially when in an outbreak.

2 new cases of measles reported in the Laurentians, 24 total in Quebec
---------------------------------------------------------------
The measles outbreak that started in Quebec last December [2024] continues to grow, although the number of cases has not exploded. In all, there have been 24 cases of measles in the province. Two new cases in the Laurentians were reported to public health on 18 Feb [2025].

This is the most affected region, with 17 cases, but the Montreal, Laval, and Mont√©r√©gie are also affected.

Measles is considered to be a highly contagious disease as a single case can infect 16 unprotected people. The main symptoms are high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and general malaise, followed by rashes on the face and body. Measles can also lead to serious complications, particularly for babies, such as blindness, encephalitis, pneumonia, and, in rare cases, death.

At a Sant√© Qu√©bec press briefing on 14 Feb [2025], Quebec Public Health director Dr. Luc Boileau was already reporting an increase in the number of cases in recent weeks. ""We are seriously concerned about the evolution of measles,"" he said.

Boileau added that his main concern was that measles was circulating in communities and ""entering schools,"" as many children were not being vaccinated. Since there is no cure for measles, the best way to protect yourself is to get vaccinated, public health says. According to Quebec's vaccination schedule, children receive the vaccine at 12 and 18 months, but it can be given free of charge at any age.

For each case of measles reported in Quebec, a public health investigation is carried out to determine the origin of the infection and to identify people at risk of being exposed. ""Our concern is that we're starting to have cases where we're having trouble linking them to others. This means that it can circulate a bit in the community,"" said Boileau.

Ontario is also experiencing a measles outbreak. As of 12 Feb [2025], 57 confirmed cases and 6 probable cases of measles had been reported in the province. There are no other Canadian provinces with outbreaks, according to the latest data from Canada Public Health. Although measles has been eliminated in Canada, it remains endemic in other countries, and, as a result, imported cases continue to spread the disease.

Health unit warns of another measles exposure at London Children's Hospital
-------------------------------------------------------
Health officials say those who were in the waiting room of the children's emergency room at Victoria Hospital may have been exposed to measles, the highly contagious virus that has been spreading in the region.

Someone with measles was in the pediatric ER from about 5:30 p.m. to 7:45 p.m. on 20 Feb [2025], officials with the Middlesex London Health Unit say. Previously, the health unit warned that someone with measles was in that waiting room on 18 Feb [2025] from 8:45 p.m. to 11:15 p.m.

""Measles cases are on the rise across the province, primarily affecting children,"" said Dr. Janice Mok. ""As individuals seek medical attention, this has and can continue to lead to exposures within health-care settings.""

Those who suspect they or their child has measles should seek medical care, but health officials ask that they phone ahead so staff can take precautions to prevent further spread.

Those who think they've been exposed should check their immunization records to make sure they're up to date on their measles vaccinations, which are noted as MMR or MMRV on the records. In general, those born before 1970 are considered immune against measles.

Anyone who was exposed and is immunocompromised, is pregnant and not immune, or who was at the ER with an unvaccinated infant should contact the health unit immediately.

People who are unvaccinated, including kids under the age of one, are at the highest risk.

There are no confirmed cases of measles within the Middlesex-London Health Unit boundary, but there's an outbreak for areas covered by Southwestern Public Health, which includes Woodstock, St. Thomas, and Oxford and Elgin counties.

Alberta Health Services (AHS) has issued a public health alert following confirmation of a hepatitis A case in a food handler at Meltwich Kensington in Calgary. The employee worked at the 405, 10 Street NW location while infectious, potentially exposing customers who visited between February 2 and February 19 [2025].

Health officials are offering post-exposure immunization for eligible individuals who consumed food or beverages at the restaurant between February 6 and February 19 [2025]. These preventive vaccinations must be administered within 14 days of exposure to be effective. Affected customers are urged to contact Health Link at 1-866-301-2668 for exposure assessment and vaccination scheduling information. Special immunization clinics will be established in Calgary to accommodate eligible individuals.

For those who visited the restaurant between February 2 and February 5 [2025], the window for preventive immunization has passed. These individuals should monitor themselves for symptoms over the next 50 days and seek medical attention if any develop. The monitoring period applies to all exposed individuals who do not receive the preventive vaccine.

Hepatitis A symptoms typically include fatigue, poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. Later stages may present with dark urine, light-colored stools, and yellowing of the eyes and skin. While some individuals, particularly young children, may be asymptomatic, they can still transmit the virus to others.

The virus spreads through the fecal-oral route, primarily through direct contact with infected individuals or by consuming contaminated food or water. Proper hand hygiene after using the bathroom is crucial in preventing transmission, especially for food service workers. When infected individuals don't follow proper hand washing protocols, the virus can contaminate food and beverages they prepare.

Alerta epidemiol√≥gica: detectaron 4 casos de sarampi√≥n en Buenos Aires. Las primeras fueron dos ni√±as con antecedente reciente de viaje y sin vacunas. Luego, un docente y un vecino del entorno. El sarampi√≥n es una de las enfermedades m√°s contagiosas y cada caso implica riesgo de brote. La ca√≠da en la cobertura de vacunaci√≥n agrava el panorama.
Tras la confirmaci√≥n de cuatro casos de sarampi√≥n en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, m√°s otros en estudio, el gobierno porte√±o anunci√≥ que se revisar√°n los carnets de vacunaci√≥n en las escuelas ‚Äìaunque el certificado es requerido para el ingreso, por lo que la cobertura deber√≠a estar asegurada- y se ampliar√°n los horarios de atenci√≥n de los vacunatorios para reforzar la inoculaci√≥n. Se trata de una enfermedad viral altamente contagiosa que requiere un 95% de cobertura de vacunaci√≥n para estar bajo control.

‚ÄúEl Ministerio de Salud de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires ha confirmado cuatro casos de sarampi√≥n en la ciudad. La detecci√≥n de estos casos ha activado una serie de medidas sanitarias con el objetivo de contener la propagaci√≥n del virus y reforzar la vacunaci√≥n en la comunidad‚Äù, anunci√≥ este domingo el gobierno de Jorge Macri. Pero hasta primera hora de este lunes a√∫n no hab√≠a informaci√≥n sobre el brote en las redes sociales del distrito.

Los primeros casos confirmados fueron dos ni√±as con antecedente reciente de viaje a Rusia y sin vacunaci√≥n. El tercero, informado diez d√≠as atr√°s, correspond√≠a a un docente que habr√≠a estado con esa familia. El cuarto, anunciado en las √∫ltimas horas, un joven vecino de las ni√±as. Seg√∫n confirmaron fuentes del gobierno porte√±o al diario La Naci√≥n, hay otros casos en estudio que tambi√©n estuvieron en contacto con los primeros, en la Comuna 14, y todos corresponden al mismo cl√∫ster.

La Sociedad Argentina de Infectolog√≠a (SADI) tambi√©n emiti√≥ una alerta epidemiol√≥gica tras la confirmaci√≥n del cuarto caso. 

De acuerdo a los datos disponibles hasta diciembre, la tasa de cobertura de la primera dosis de la vacuna contra el sarampi√≥n a nivel nacional alcanzaba el 81,6% de la poblaci√≥n. Pero, para el refuerzo de los cinco a√±os, esa proporci√≥n ca√≠a al 54,8%.

‚ÄúEste a√±o hubo un incremento del 10% en la baja de cobertura en vacunas. Hoy podemos decir que m√°s de la mitad de los ni√±os de Argentina no tienen el carnet de vacunaci√≥n completo, con lo que veremos reemerger enfermedades como polio, sarampi√≥n, varicela, entra otras enfermedades contagiosas que hoy est√°n controladas‚Äù, dec√≠a a este diario, en septiembre, el m√©dico Oscar Atienza, mag√≠ster en Salud P√∫blica.

‚ÄúToda ca√≠da en las coberturas es preocupante, pero hay algunas enfermedades donde la tasa de transmisi√≥n es muy elevada, como el sarampi√≥n, que un descenso en las coberturas puede facilitar un brote muy importante‚Äù, advert√≠a por entonces Pablo Bonveh√≠, jefe de infectolog√≠a de Cemic e integrante del Grupo T√©cnico Asesor en Inmunizaciones de la OPS. Hubo alarmas recientes en ese sentido. En 2019, al final del gobierno macrista, se registr√≥ el peor brote de sarampi√≥n de las √∫ltimas dos d√©cadas.

Bonveh√≠ se√±alaba en aquel momento la necesidad de m√°s campa√±as de difusi√≥n por parte del Estado y de la implementaci√≥n de dispositivos en los √°mbitos educativos: ‚ÄúLa comunicaci√≥n es fundamental para revertir esta situaci√≥n y poder mejorar las coberturas‚Äù. Propon√≠a ‚Äúconsiderar la vacunaci√≥n en las escuelas, que en muchos pa√≠ses como Chile se lleva a cabo y permite mantener buenas coberturas‚Äù. Tambi√©n apuntaba al rol de las y los profesionales de la salud en los consultorios.

La ca√≠da en las tasas de vacunaci√≥n y su impacto ‚Äìen un marco de crecientes discursos antivacunas- no s√≥lo se evidencian en Argentina. En Estados Unidos, el Departamento de Servicios de Salud del Estado de Texas confirm√≥ al menos 90 casos, 77 de ellos en menores de 17 a√±os y s√≥lo cinco con vacunaci√≥n completa. El peligro es creciente en los √∫ltimos a√±os: los casos de sarampi√≥n en Europa pasaron de 900 en 2022 a m√°s de 42.000 en 2023.

A child who was not vaccinated has died from measles in West Texas, the first death in an outbreak that began late last month [January 2025] and the first from measles in the US since 2015. The death was a ""school-aged child who was not vaccinated"" and had been hospitalized last week, the Texas Department of State Health Services said Wednesday [26 Feb 2025] in a statement. Lubbock health officials also confirmed the death, but neither agency provided more details. Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. CDC confirmed this is the first measles death in the country since 2015.

The measles outbreak in rural West Texas has grown to 124 cases across 9 counties, which state health officials have said is Texas' largest in nearly 30 years. There are also 9 cases in eastern New Mexico.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that the US Department of Health and Human Services is ""watching"" the outbreak, which he described as ""not unusual"" during a Wednesday [26 Feb 2025] meeting of President Donald Trump's cabinet members. The health secretary did not provide specifics on how or if the federal agency is assisting on the ground.

""The loss of a child is a tragedy,"" and Gov. Greg Abbott and his wife are praying for ""the family, loved ones, and the entire Lubbock community,"" Abbott spokesman Andrew Mahaleris said. He added that the governor's office is in ""regular communication"" with the state health department, that epidemiologists and vaccination teams are in the ""affected area,"" and that there are ""daily situation updates and coordination calls"" with local health officials. ""The state will deploy all necessary resources to ensure the safety and health of Texans,"" Mahaleris said.

Vaccination rates across the USA have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners -- the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks. Measles cases were the worst in almost 3 decades in 2019, and there was a rise in cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.

The outbreak is largely spreading in the Mennonite community in West Texas, where small towns are separated by vast stretches of oil-rig-dotted open land but connected due to people traveling between towns for work, church, grocery shopping, and other errands. Texas health department data shows the vast majority of cases in the area are among people younger than 18. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine -- which is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases -- is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old for the first shot, with the second coming between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide.

The cases in West Texas have been concentrated in a ""close-knit, undervaccinated"" Mennonite community, state health department spokesperson Lara Anton has said, especially among families who attend small private religious schools or are homeschooled. Gaines County, which has 80 cases, has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year.

Earlier this month [February 2025], Kennedy said a panel would investigate the childhood vaccine schedule that prevents measles and other dangerous diseases.

Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to 2 hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC. Most kids will recover from the measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling, and death. The CDC is providing ""technical assistance, laboratory support, and vaccines as needed"" to West Texas, the agency told the AP, but the state health department is taking the lead in the outbreak investigation.

A news conference is scheduled in Lubbock on Wednesday [26 Feb 2025] afternoon.

Measles Outbreak - February 25, 2025
------------------------------------
The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is reporting an outbreak of measles in the South Plains region of Texas. At this time, 124 cases have been identified since late January 2025. Eighteen of the patients have been hospitalized. Five of the cases are vaccinated. The rest are unvaccinated, or their vaccination status is unknown. Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak.

We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays if there are new cases to report.

According to the State Health Department, there are at least 92 measles cases, including 2 in Houston. The biggest concern is an outbreak in West Texas, where 90 cases are. We know 85 cases are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. In January 2025, the Houston Health Department confirmed that the 2 measles cases were connected to unvaccinated adults' international air travel. The department's website lists possible exposure locations.

Dr. Janeana White with the Houston Health Department said the first person was hospitalized and recovered, and the other person was monitored and is okay. Right now, the city is working to inform the public and working closely with neighboring health departments to raise situational awareness.

""I say that it's not just the providers who care for patients. Providers may not have seen cases in their training. We are bringing information to providers, reminding them what symptoms to look for (and) how they are going to evaluate patients if they are going to come into the practice because it is contagious. Think about not having someone sit in the waiting room for a long period,"" Dr. White said.

""The Ministry of Health of the City of Buenos Aires has confirmed 4 cases of measles in the city. The detection of these cases has activated a series of health measures with the aim of containing the spread of the virus and reinforcing vaccination in the community,"" the government of Jorge Macri announced this Sunday [23 Feb 2025]. But until early Monday [24 Feb 2025], there was still no information about the outbreak on the district's social networks.

The first confirmed cases were 2 girls with a recent travel history to Russia and without vaccination. The third, reported 10 days ago, corresponded to a teacher who had been with that family. The fourth, announced in the last few hours, is a young neighbor of the girls. As sources from the Buenos Aires government confirmed to the newspaper La Naci√≥n, there are other cases under study that were also in contact with the first, in Commune 14, and they all correspond to the same cluster. The Argentine Society of Infectious Diseases (SADI) also issued an epidemiological alert after the confirmation of the fourth case.

According to the data available through December 2024, the coverage rate of the first dose of the measles vaccine at the national level reached 81.6% of the population. But for the 5-year reinforcement, that proportion fell to 54.8%. ""This year [2024] there was a 10% increase in vaccine coverage. Today we can say that more than half of the children in Argentina do not have a complete vaccination card, so we will see the re-emergence of diseases such as polio, measles, chickenpox, among other contagious diseases that are controlled today,"" Doctor Oscar Atienza, MPH, told this newspaper in September [2024].

""Any drop in coverage is worrying, but there are some diseases where the transmission rate is very high, such as measles, where a decrease in coverage can facilitate a very important outbreak,"" warned Pablo Bonveh√≠, head of infectious diseases at Cemic and member of the PAHO Technical Advisory Group on Immunizations. There were recent alarms in that regard. In 2019, at the end of the Macrista government, the worst measles outbreak in the last 2 decades was recorded.

Bonveh√≠ pointed out at that time the need for more dissemination campaigns by the State and the implementation of devices in educational settings: ""Communication is essential to reverse this situation and be able to improve coverage."" He proposed ""considering vaccination in schools, which is carried out in many countries like Chile and allows good coverage to be maintained."" He also pointed to the role of health professionals in clinics.

The drop in vaccination rates and its impact -- in a framework of growing anti-vaccine discourses -- are not only evident in Argentina. In the United States, the Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed at least 90 cases, 77 of them in children under 17 years of age. The danger has been growing in recent years: measles cases in Europe rose from 900 in 2022 to more than 42 000 in 2023.

Vaccination status is classified as unknown when the case investigation is still ongoing or when the person does not know if they were ever vaccinated.

The investigations into the cases who are currently classified as vaccinated are ongoing. A dose of MMR is given to unvaccinated people within 72 hours of their exposure to the measles to lessen the severity of the illness if they get sick from their exposure to the virus. We are looking into if any of these cases received their MMR dose after exposure.

The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with 2 doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.

<https://ktla.com/news/local-news/orange-county-infant-arrived-in-los-angeles-from-korea-with-measles-officials/>


The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health stated that a case of measles has been confirmed in a person who traveled to LAX while infectious last week and Orange County officials have clarified their identity. According to the LA County Health Department, the infected individual arrived on Korean Air Flight 11 at Tom Bradley International Terminal B on February 19 [2025]. Flight 11 is one of Korean Air's nonstop Seoul to Los Angeles routes.

In a statement issued Tuesday [25 Feb 2025], the health department clarified that individuals who were at Terminal B between 1 pm and 4 pm on February 19 [2025] ""may be at risk of developing measles due to exposure to this traveler.""

""In collaboration with the CDC, passengers assigned to specific seats that may have been exposed on Korean Airlines Flight 11 on February 19 [2025] will be notified by local departments of health,"" Los Angeles County officials said. ""These agencies work together to investigate communicable disease exposures on international flights to the United States.""

In a separate release, the Orange County Health Care Agency identified the person as an infant returning home following international travel but also stated that there were no additional community exposures due to the patient. That said, health officials say that anyone who may have been exposed to measles is at risk of severe outcomes, especially young children, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems.

<https://www.fox13seattle.com/news/first-measles-case-2025-confirmed>


Public Health - Seattle & King County has confirmed the first measles case of 2025 in Washington in a King County infant, with potential public exposure at multiple locations. Health officials urge residents to check their vaccination status as measles is highly contagious.

The case was confirmed on February 26 [2025] after the infant likely contracted measles during recent travel abroad. Officials stress that measles spreads easily, with up to 90% of unvaccinated individuals exposed to the virus becoming infected. ""We are seeing increases in measles cases within and outside the United States,"" said Dr. Eric Chow, communicable disease chief for Public Health - Seattle & King County. ""Talk to your doctor about checking your vaccination status and get vaccinated now if you aren't already protected.""

Public health officials have listed several locations where the infected infant was present while contagious. Measles can linger in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person leaves.

Anyone who visited these sites during the listed times may have been exposed:
20 Feb 2025, 6 pm-9 pm: Apple Store at Bellevue Square, Bellevue
21-22 Feb 2025, 10:30 pm-2:15 am: Seattle Children's Hospital Emergency Department, Seattle
24 Feb 2025, 1 pm-4:15 pm: Allegro Pediatrics, Bothell
25 Feb 2025 1 pm-4 pm: Northwest Asthma & Allergy Center, Redmond
25 Feb 2025 2:30 pm-5:30 pm: Seattle Children's Hospital Emergency Department, Seattle

Most King County residents are vaccinated, reducing overall risk. However, those who were at these locations during the exposure times should:
- Check their measles vaccination status.
- Watch for symptoms, including fever, rash, cough and red, watery eyes.
- Call a healthcare provider before visiting a clinic if symptoms appear.
- Avoid contact with vulnerable individuals, such as infants and those with weakened immune systems.
- If exposed, symptoms could appear between February 27 and March 18 [2025].

Measles is preventable with the MMR vaccine, which is about 97% effective after 2 doses. However, according to Public Health - Seattle & King County, vaccination rates in King County remain below the herd immunity threshold of 95%, increasing the risk of outbreaks.

Current King County immunization stats:
- 87% of 2 year olds in King County have received 1 dose of MMR.
- 72% of 4 to 6 year olds have received the recommended 2 doses.

Infants, young children and those with compromised immune systems are at the highest risk for complications, including pneumonia and brain inflammation.

In 2024, there were 3 cases of measles [reported] in King County.

New measles cases tied to NJ patient who visited 3 health facilities
------------------------------------------------------------
New Jersey health officials have confirmed 2 additional cases of measles in the state this year [2025] linked to a Bergen County resident who recently traveled internationally. The initial case was reported 14 Feb [2025] in an unvaccinated person. The state Department of Health officials warned that the person may have exposed others during a visit to the emergency department at Englewood Hospital in Bergen County on 9 Feb between 11:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Two additional cases had been identified, both involving individuals who had close contact with the original patient, health officials said.

The original patient may have also spread the virus at Hackensack University Medical Center and an urgent care facility in Fort Lee, according to a NorthJersey.com report. However, a spokesperson for the Hackensack hospital said the patient, a child with measles, was transferred from another hospital and immediately placed into isolation. Public health authorities were notified, and a thorough assessment confirmed that all team members involved had immunity, with no direct exposure to other patients, the spokesperson said.

""While we cannot share specific patient details due to privacy regulations, we remain committed to protecting the health and safety of our patients, staff, and community,"" the spokesperson said.

A 14 Feb [2025] news release from state officials about the potential exposure at Englewood did not disclose that the patient had also visited the urgent care center and the Hackensack hospital.

Officials said the 2 new cases had been under quarantine, which significantly reduced the risk of further transmission. The 2 new cases also involved unvaccinated people, state officials said.

The state health department is working with local health agencies to track any possible exposures and notify individuals who may have been in contact with the infected patients when they were contagious. The department is urging residents to check vaccination records and ensure they are up to date, particularly for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which provides protection against the highly contagious virus.

The outbreak in New Jersey comes amid a surge in measles cases across the United States. A child who wasn't vaccinated died in a measles outbreak in rural West Texas, state officials said Wednesday [26 Feb 2025], the first USA death from the highly contagious -- but preventable -- respiratory disease since 2015.

As of 20 Feb [2025], the CDC reported a total of 93 measles cases in Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island, and Texas.

Kentucky health officials announced Wednesday [26 Feb 2025] that a case of measles has been confirmed in the commonwealth.

The Kentucky Department for Public Health and Frankfort County Health Department said the individual who tested positive recently traveled internationally in areas with ongoing measles transmissions before visiting a fitness center in Frankfort. The individual attended Planet Fitness at 101 Allen Way in Frankfort from 9:00 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., Monday [24 Feb 2025]. Health officials are working to identify and contact the individuals who may have been exposed at that location.

""Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world,"" Kentucky Department for Public Health Commissioner Dr. Steven Stack said. ""Fortunately, measles can be prevented with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is safe and effective. Vaccines are an essential tool to keep children and adults safe and healthy.""

The Kentucky case is the first confirmed since February 2023 and comes quickly after the first measles death since 2015, USA Today reports. A child in Gaines County, Texas, recently died of the illness and at least 124 in the state are known to be infected.

Rockwall County reports first confirmed case of measles
------------------------------------------------------
Rockwall County said a resident who traveled overseas tested positive for measles and was hospitalized. On Wednesday [26 Feb 2025] afternoon, the Rockwall County Commissioners Court released a statement on social media alerting the community.

The Texas Department of State Health Services said the person is an unvaccinated adult who traveled to Asia. They do not believe this case is related to the measles outbreak in West Texas.

The state doesn't believe the individual was contagious while in transit or visited public places while contagious. There is no timeline of the person's travel or when they became ill, but Rockwall County said it learned Tuesday [25 Feb 2025] night about the positive test.

Jarod Rosson, the Emergency Management Coordinator for Rockwall County, said an epidemiologist reached out to those who had been in contact with the person, including some first responders like firefighters and EMS.

""Some first responders have been in contact with this person, and we've contacted each of them individually through their department to make sure they have the information that they need,"" explained Rosson.

It's unclear how the patient is doing or what city they're from. The county said it can't release more details for privacy reasons.

""The message at this time, especially since it's an isolated case -- we don't expect this to become an outbreak like what we're seeing in Gaines County -- is to take the precautions they feel are necessary, whether that's vaccination or standard precautions for any communicable diseases, such as washing your hands, staying home if you're sick,"" said Rosson.

Rockwall Independent School District said it is aware of the adult measles case in the county. At this time, there are no reported cases within the schools, according to RISD.

Key messages
-----------
An outbreak of measles has been identified in Victoria, after 2 new cases were reported who likely acquired their infection in metropolitan Melbourne. These cases have had no history of overseas travel or known contact with other cases of measles.

These cases were infectious at multiple locations around Melbourne and Greater Bendigo. People who have attended a listed exposure site during the specified dates [see original URL - Mod.LL] and times should monitor for symptoms of measles and follow the instructions below.

Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can spread from person to person and potentially lead to serious health complications including pneumonia and brain inflammation (encephalitis).

Anyone who develops symptoms of measles should seek medical care and testing for measles. Wear a face mask and call ahead to make sure you can be isolated from others.

Healthcare professionals should be alert for measles in patients with fever and rash, particularly those who have recently returned from overseas or attended a listed exposure site during the specified period.

Clinicians should also consider measles in people with compatible symptoms who have spent time in metropolitan Melbourne in the prior 7 to 18 days.

Suspected cases should be tested, advised to isolate, and notified to the Department of Health immediately by calling 1300 651 160.

All Victorians are eligible to receive the free measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine if born during or after 1966. Two doses are required for immunity.

Victorians born between 1966 and 1992 may not have received 2 doses of vaccine. If you are unsure, see an immunisation provider now to ask for an MMR vaccine.

Anyone planning overseas travel should make sure they have received appropriate travel vaccinations, including the MMR vaccine. This is especially important for anyone planning on travelling to South and South-East Asia, including Viet Nam.

Austin Public Health on Friday [28 Feb 2025] announced Austin's first measles case during a statewide outbreak after an infant tested positive. It is the first case in Austin since 2019.

The case was in a baby too young to be vaccinated. The baby and their family traveled out of the country where they were exposed to measles, said Dr. Desmar Walkes, the Austin-Travis County health authority. The rest of the family was vaccinated. They are currently isolating. To be vaccinated, [generally - Mod.LL] children have to be at least 1 year old.

The Texas Department of State Health Services on Friday [28 Feb 2025] upped its measles count to 146 cases in the state with 20 people hospitalized. Walkes noted another 2 cases since that update, including the Austin one. A school-age child died from the highly contagious virus this week. That child was not vaccinated.

Most people don't know they are infected with measles before they have infected someone else, said Dr. Rama Thyagarajan, an infectious disease expert and an associate professor at the University of Texas Dell Medical School. The disease is also not something primary care doctors are used to screening for or suspecting as a possible cause for the flulike symptoms that begin a measles case, she said. ""It is always a good idea with any respiratory illness to stay home,"" Thyagarajan said.

Austin isn't currently experiencing a measles outbreak, Walkes said, but a particular concern is the area's vaccination rates, which are less than 91%. Anything below 90% means the risk of a community having an outbreak is 51%. There are schools and parts of Travis County that are below the 90% vaccination rate, she said.

Travis County Judge Andy Brown implored the community to get vaccinated. ""We need the vaccination rate to go up,"" he said. ""We shouldn't be here today,"" he said. Misinformation around vaccines has caused rates around the country to fall, making an outbreak possible, he said.

Austin hospitals and Austin Public Health are preparing for the possibility of an outbreak, Walkes said. ""We are ready and prepared,"" she said. ""We have processes in place.""

In some cases, you can give the vaccine to infants who are 6 months or older, especially if they have been exposed. Health officials have not made that recommendation for all infants 6 months or older, yet, Walkes said, but that recommendation might change if Austin does experience an outbreak. If you do get your 6- to 11-month-old vaccinated, they would need a second shot at age 1 and then a third shot at age 4, Cook said.

Infants who have not been vaccinated need to be kept away from exposure in an outbreak, and the people around them should be vaccinated, Thyagarajan said. The same is true for anyone who cannot receive the vaccine because of health conditions such as cancer treatments or an organ transplant.

Austin Public Health does rely on the federal government for most of its funding. US Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, said he worries that this measles outbreak and the bird flu outbreak could be affected by job and funding cuts at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which helps fund local health departments, and a reduction by the Trump administration in the communications coming out of the CDC.

""I fear another deadly pandemic,"" he said. ""Without the infrastructure, we can't get the job done.""

Because Austin does not currently have an outbreak, plans are not changing for the upcoming South by Southwest festival, Austin Mayor Kirk Watson said. Friday's [28 Feb 2025] news conference was scheduled before Austin Public Health knew about the Austin measles case and had already intended to ask everyone to get vaccinated, especially as more people are coming into the Austin area and traveling outside of the area. ""Vaccination remains the best defense,"" Watson said. ""It's time to check and make sure you are up to date with vaccines.""

A measles outbreak in Canada's Ontario province continues to grow, with health officials reporting more than 140 cases on Thursday [27 Feb 2025], making it the most severe outbreak in decades. Public Health Ontario said in an update that so far in 2025, it has seen a total of 119 confirmed and 23 probable cases of the highly infectious disease, with all but 2 associated with an ongoing multijurisdictional outbreak that began in the fall [2024].

The officials have traced the outbreak back to a travel-related case in New Brunswick on October 18 [2024]. While the maritime province has since declared its outbreak over, Ontario continues to battle transmission. A total of 177 cases have been reported in Ontario going back to October 2024, but infections have spiked since the middle of January 2025.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the province saw between 7 and 22 cases a year, Public Health Canada said, with 101 confirmed cases reported between 2013 and 2023. In 2024, there were 37 cases associated with the ongoing outbreak, officials said.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background and Objectives
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) poses a significant public health challenge worldwide, contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective vaccines, immunoglobulins and antiviral medications, HBV prevalence remains high in developing regions. This study investigates the potential risk factors associated with HBV infection in the Kurdistan region of Iraq to aid in developing targeted prevention strategies.

Design and Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 4091 participants from Duhok and Zakho, in Kurdistan region of Iraq. Data on demographics and potential risk factors were collected via a structured questionnaire. HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was screened using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine infection status. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify independent risk factors.

Results
The mean age of enrolled participants was 29.33 years ¬± 10.74. Among them, 2851/4091 (69.69%) were females, 3385/4091 (82.74%) were residents of city and 3682/4091 (88.68%) were married. The prevalence of HBV infection among them was 3.67% (150/4091) and the following factors were significantly associated with HBV infection: female gender (p = 0.001), rural residency (p = 0.001), being married (p = 0.0014). Though a history of general operation and tattooing was found to be associated with HBV infection, this association was lost in multivariate analysis (p > 0.05) possibly due to confounding effect. A history of receiving blood or dental procedure was not significantly associated with HBV infection (p > 0.05).

Conclusion
The prevalence of HBV infection in Duhok and Zakho remains high and several predictive factors were identified which can be used to target infection control measures. Future research should focus on a population-based study to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of HBV infection to better inform public health policies.

A measles case confirmed in Montgomery County is PA's first in 2025, the CDC says
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A patient who came to a hospital emergency room in Montgomery County is Pennsylvania's first confirmed measles case in 2025 amid a national surge of the highly contagious virus, according to health officials.

According to the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services Office of Public Health, an infected patient was seen at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in King of Prussia on Wednesday [26 Feb 2025]. No other details about the patient were available Saturday [1 Mar 2025].

""More information will be shared regarding exposure sites, dates, and times when available,"" a spokesperson for the county's public health office said in a written statement. ""CHOP and the Office of Public Health have been in contact with potentially affected individuals.""

Measles is a highly infectious virus that spreads through breathing in infected air or touching infected surfaces, according to the CDC. The illness can be especially dangerous for children under 5, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems. A measles infection can lead to respiratory failure, inflammation of the brain, and death. The virus can also, in rare cases, cause a years-long decline of the brain that results in death. Symptoms, which include a high fever, cough, koplik spots (lesions on the inner lining of cheeks), and a rash, can appear about a week or 2 after exposure.

The local case is one of 164 across 9 states this year as of Thursday [27 Feb 2025], according to the CDC's most recent data [see below - Mod.LL].

In January 2024, there were 8 reported measles cases in Philadelphia, including 5 infected children from a northeast day-care center. The first of 6 people to be hospitalized for treatment was an infant at CHOP, who contracted the disease in early December 2023 while outside the country.

While the USA eliminated measles in 2000, Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at CHOP, said the ongoing outbreaks are caused by a ""critical percentage"" of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children.

Based on a new report from Children First PA, the non-medical exemption rate of Philadelphia kindergartners (those who request vaccination exemptions for reasons other than medical need) quadrupled from 0.6% to 2.4% between 2015 and 2024. Offit said the reason a growing number of families are avoiding the MMR vaccine is because of the spread of disinformation and the mishandling of cases by figures like Kennedy.

""You have someone who's the head of Health and Human Services who hasn't stood up and said the one thing you want to hear him say, which is get vaccinated and vaccinate your children.""

Of every 1000 children who are infected with the disease, between one and 3 will die, according to the Philadelphia Department of Health.

Nearly 34% of the 164 reported measles cases in 2025 involve children 5 and under, and 48% are between ages 5 and 19, according to the CDC.

To prevent the contraction and spread of the disease, health officials highly recommend the MMR vaccine. One dose, which babies can receive when they are a year old, is 93% effective at preventing measles, according to the CDC. Two doses improve that rate to 97%.

Through a statement, the Ministry of Health confirmed that on 27 Feb [2025] a minor aged one month and 25 days died from whooping cough in Bogota.

""This is an unusual event that should raise alarm bells about the importance of vaccination, since whooping cough can be serious and even fatal in young children,"" said the secretariat.

An urgent call is also made for the vaccination of the at-risk population.

""In Colombia we also observed an increase in confirmed cases, which forces us to reinforce prevention and control strategies. In Bogota, 505 probable cases of whooping cough were reported [over what time span? - Mod.LL], of which 11 were confirmed, with an incidence of 1.95 cases per 100 000 children under one year of age. Nine of these cases occurred in babies under one year of age, the most vulnerable group to this disease.

According to information, in 2025, as of 21 Feb [2025], 22 probable cases and 3 confirmed cases have been reported in children under 5 years of age, 2 of them in the town of Suba [a locality in Bogota - Mod.LL],"" he added.

Cameroon reported a type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) from environmental isolates collected in the Kousseri Health District of the Far North Region on 27 Jan 2025.

This outbreak occurred after the country recorded various cVDPV2 cases in 2024. The most recent was cVDPV2 confirmed from a 9-year-old who presented with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) on 12 Dec 2024 in Kousserie Health District and a type 2 novel oral polio vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV2-n) in a 5-year-old in Vele Health District in the Far North Region who had AFP on 2 Dec 2024.

Earlier in 2024, Cameroon reported 4 isolates of cVDPV2, including 2 from cases of AFP in the Ndelele and Batouri health districts of the East Region and 2 from environmental isolates in the Ngaoundere Urbain District in the Adamawa Region and Deido Health District in the Littoral Region.

The country conducted a national mass polio vaccination campaign using the type 2 novel oral polio vaccine (nOPV2) in 2024 and 2 sub-national vaccination campaigns with nOPV2. The last round was in November 2024.

Measles cases in Hanoi continue to increase
-------------------------------------------
According to the CDC, Hanoi recorded 96 measles cases last week [week of 23 Feb 2025], bringing the total to 625 cases since the beginning of the year [2025], while there were no cases recorded in the same period last year [2024].

Specifically, children under 6 months old account for 10%, from 6-8 months old is 15%, from 9-11 months old is 11%, from 1-5 years old is 23.5% and from 6-10 years old is 15%. The group of over 10 years old accounts for the highest rate at 25%.

Most cases have been in people who have not been vaccinated or have not been fully vaccinated. Notably, the number of cases in children aged 6-8 months is on the rise. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) predicts that this situation will continue in the near future.

The current weather in the North, characterized by drizzle and high humidity, creates favorable conditions for respiratory diseases, including measles, to spread rapidly. Therefore, vaccination is the most effective and important measure to prevent the spread.
  
In this situation, Hanoi has launched a measles vaccination campaign for children aged 6 to under 9 months. As of 27 Feb 2025, the city has vaccinated more than 8600 out of a total of 18 702 children, reaching 46% of the plan, with more than 7600 children vaccinated at health stations and nearly 1000 children vaccinated at service facilities.

Next week, CDC will continue to monitor the vaccination campaign and maintain a regular vaccination pace in areas such as Thanh Oai, Ung Hoa, Chuong My, Phuc Tho, Hoan Kiem, Bac Tu Liem, Dong Anh, Ha Dong and Hai Ba Trung. This is an effort to quickly control the increase of measles in the city.

In addition to measles, the CDC also recorded cases of dengue fever, hand, foot and mouth disease, and whooping cough. However, the number of these cases remained stable or decreased. Other diseases such as COVID-19, meningococcus, and streptococcus suis recorded no cases this week.

Measles is transmitted through the respiratory tract by coughing, sneezing, close contact with infected people or nasal secretions. The disease is characterized by fever, inflammation of the respiratory tract, conjunctivitis and rash.

Children with measles mostly recover on their own, but some groups such as thos with immunodeficiency, cancer, chronic diseases, and congenital heart disease are at risk of severe progression, possibly death. Children with measles often have long-term reduced immunity, and are susceptible to malnutrition and other diseases later.

30 confirmed measles cases in Quebec
----------------------------------
Quebec has reached 30 cases of measles, according to the most recent public health figures. The Laurentians region remains the most affected with 27 cases of measles; the others are in Montreal, Laval, and the Mont√©r√©gie.

Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself against this highly contagious disease, says public health. Quebec's vaccination schedule requires children to receive the vaccine at 12 and 18 months, but it can be administered free of charge at any age.

The Ministry of Health reported last week that vaccination coverage for primary and secondary school students for the current school year (2024-2025) is around 90 percent. However, it noted vaccination delays among toddlers and some adult populations.

The main symptoms of measles are high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and redness of the face and body. There can be serious complications, including death for vulnerable people, especially babies who have not yet been vaccinated.

In Quebec, public health is working to contact people who have been in contact with the reported cases to inform them to be vigilant for the appearance of symptoms and to invite them to get vaccinated, if they have not already done so. If a person is not vaccinated and has been in contact with a case of measles, they must isolate themselves at home from the fifth day following their exposure to the fourteenth day. An individual is not contagious during the first 4 days following an exposure.

According to the most recent data from the Public Health Agency of Canada, Manitoba and British Columbia also have some cases of measles.

A virus has spread among children in Duhok, causing the Hevi Pediatric Hospital to be filled with patients.

Dr. Nazar Bakr, director of Hevi Pediatric Hospital in Duhok, said that some of the children are receiving oxygen therapy and are infected with the seasonal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), for which there is specific treatment.

Dr. Nazar said, ""The best way to prevent the virus is for mothers to breastfeed their babies to strengthen their immune systems and prevent them from being affected by seasonal viruses.""

According to the hospital, 15 000 patients were recorded last month [February 2025] alone, 80% of whom were infected with RSV, of whom more than 100 were hospitalized.

RSV is a common respiratory virus that causes bronchitis in children.

Oklahoma health experts are raising concerns about the rise in pertussis (whooping cough) cases. Since October 2024, doctors say they've been seeing an increase in cases. ""This is the largest whooping cough outbreak Oklahoma has experienced in 69 years,"" said Dr. George Monks, former president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association. According to the CDC, so far for 2025, there has been 77 cases of whooping cough. In 2024, there were 469 total cases and in 2020, the state only saw 20 cases.

""A lot of people missed their vaccinations during the pandemic, a lot of missed well-child checks and then also, there's more and more vaccine hesitancy,"" said Dr. Monks.

Doctors say whooping cough can be prevented if you are vaccinated. The illness starts out like a common cold, then progresses into an uncontrollable high-pitched cough. Infants can have severe complications. ""Our biggest risk for hospitalization is in our babies that are less than 6 months of age and about a third of kids under 12 months who get whooping cough will actually have to be hospitalized,"" said Dr. Stephanie DeLeon, associate chief medical officer, Oklahoma Children's Hospital.

It can be fatal; the infant death rate is 2%. ""Babies that haven't gotten their first vaccine are at risk for something called apnea, which means they will stop breathing,"" said Dr. DeLeon. Expecting mothers can get the vaccine, while pregnant [to protect the infant]. If you have a baby not old enough for the vaccine, doctors say before anyone comes in contact with them, they should have an up-to-date vaccine.

Central District Health (CDH) says an adult living within the district died of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, in February 2025. The health district covers Ada, Boise, Elmore, and Valley counties. CDH adds that while pertussis is listed as the cause of death, other health factors could have contributed.

The current pertussis outbreak has been ongoing since January 2024, with a large jump in case numbers. Since January 2024, CDH reports 574 cases of pertussis, compared to 7 cases in 2023 and 2 cases in 2022. To avoid the spread of the disease, people should wash their hands often, cough into their arm, and talk to a physician if they have a cough, runny nose, congestion, or fever.

CDH says pertussis is more severe in children and those with certain underlying health conditions. Symptoms may include a high-pitched ""whoop"" sound when inhaling at the end of a coughing fit. Other symptoms include a fever, runny nose, or congestion, but CDH says most will recognize it from the long-lasting cough.

Pertussis is preventable and treatable.

Penn State University has confirmed 3 cases of chickenpox [varicella] on its main campus in State College. Students and staff who were in Mifflin Hall between February 17 and 24 [2025] or in the Thomas Building on February 20 [2025] between 1 and 3 pm may have been exposed, the university said in a recent statement. Penn State is also working to notify close contacts of the infected individuals.

Chickenpox spreads through airborne particles and direct contact with an infected person. Symptoms typically develop 10 to 21 days after exposure, and can include the tell-tale spotted rash, fatigue, headaches and a fever lasting several days. Rarely, the disease can lead to serious complications, like infected blisters, pneumonia, bleeding disorders and brain swelling. Vaccination significantly reduces infection risk.

The university is encouraging people to check their immunization records, avoid contact with those who are sick and wash their hands often.

Measles - 4 Mar 2025
--------------------
The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is reporting an outbreak of measles in the South Plains region of Texas. At this time, 159 cases have been identified since late January 2025. Twenty-two of the patients have been hospitalized. There has been one fatality in a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area. The child was not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.

Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.

Vaccination status is classified as unknown when the case investigation is still ongoing or when the person does not know if they were ever vaccinated. The investigations into the cases who are currently classified as vaccinated are ongoing. A dose of MMR is given to unvaccinated people within 72 hours of their exposure to the measles to lessen the severity of the illness if they get sick from their exposure to the virus. We are looking into if any of these cases received their MMR dose after exposure.

The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with 2 doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.

Mexican health authorities issue alert following rise in whooping cough cases
------------------------------------------------------
Cases of whooping cough have risen in Mexico in recent months, according to an epidemiological alert issued by the National Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance (Conave) on 26 Feb [2025]. The number of cases rose from 153 in 2023 to approximately 443 in 2025, marking a 190% increase. During the first 7 weeks of 2025, there were 120 confirmed cases and 460 suspected cases of the disease across 21 states.

Brazil, the USA, and Peru have also recorded cases of whooping cough above the typical yearly average.

While adolescents and adults generally recover from whooping cough without any complication, the infection can affect babies more severely, particularly those under 6 months, restricting their breathing.

According to Mexico's Health Ministry, the states with the highest number of confirmed cases in 2025 are as follows:
- Nuevo LeÃ³n: 24 cases
- Mexico City: 13 cases
- Aguascalientes: 11 cases
- Oaxaca: 10 cases
- MÃ©xico state: 8 cases

Other states with reported cases include the following:
- Chihuahua: 7 cases
- Campeche, Hidalgo, and Coahuila: 6 cases each
- QuerÃ©taro: 5 cases
- Morelos, Tamaulipas, Guanajuato, and Jalisco: 3 cases each
- Durango, YucatÃ¡n, San Luis PotosÃ­, Baja California, and Veracruz: 2 cases each
- Guerrero and Sonora: 1 case each

En 2025, varios estados de MÃ©xico reportan un aumento de casos de Tos ferina, una enfermedad respiratoria que afecta principalmente a niÃ±os pequeÃ±os y adultos mayores.

La Tos ferina, tambiÃ©n conocida como pertussis, sigue afectando con mÃ¡s casos a distintos estados de MÃ©xico durante 2025. A pesar de los esfuerzos para controlar la enfermedad mediante programas de vacunaciÃ³n, se han reportado brotes y afectaciones, especialmente entre niÃ±os pequeÃ±os y adultos mayores.

Este resurgimiento se debe a una disminuciÃ³n en la cobertura de la inmunizaciÃ³n y a la circulaciÃ³n activa de la bacteria con la llegada de personas de otras regiones a la ciudades, afectando especialmente a aquellos no vacunados o con esquemas incompletos.

Estos son los estados de MÃ©xico que concentran mÃ¡s casos de Tos ferina hasta 2025
Hasta el 2025, algunos de los estados con un nÃºmero alarmante de casos confirmados y sospechosos de Tos ferina incluyen:
Nuevo LeÃ³n: 24 casos confirmados y 56 probables.
Ciudad de MÃ©xico: 13 casos confirmados y 73 en investigaciÃ³n.
Aguascalientes: 11 casos confirmados y 24 probables.
Oaxaca: 10 casos confirmados y 19 en observaciÃ³n.
Chihuahua: 7 casos confirmados y 24 en anÃ¡lisis.

De igual manera, otros estados como Campeche, Hidalgo y QuerÃ©taro tambiÃ©n presentan cifras preocupantes, aunque con menor incidencia en comparaciÃ³n con los estados mencionados anteriormente. Las autoridades sanitarias del paÃ­s continÃºan monitoreando los brotes y realizando campaÃ±as de vacunaciÃ³n, especialmente dirigidas a grupos vulnerables, como reciÃ©n nacidos, mujeres embarazadas y adultos mayores.

Currently, 6 patients have recovered, while 9 cases are isolated and treated at home. Epidemiological investigation shows that 13 cases have not been vaccinated against chickenpox.

In addition to chickenpox, in recent days, some infectious diseases such as measles, whooping cough, and hand-foot-mouth disease have tended to increase. From the beginning of the year [2025] to the beginning of March [2025], the whole province had 66 cases of measles, 9 cases of hand-foot-mouth disease, and 8 cases of whooping cough.

It is the time of changing seasons; hot and humid weather creates favorable conditions for infectious diseases to arise and spread quickly. To limit the outbreak of disease, the most effective measure is to get vaccinated.

Overview
--------
Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.

The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.

Reports
-------
The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is so contagious, additional cases are likely to occur in Lea County and the surrounding communities.

Measles confirmed in New York City infant and child. Here's how the virus can affect children
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New York is now among 9 states reporting measles cases [Now 10 with Florida - Mod.LL]. In Texas, the measles have sickened nearly 160 people -- most unvaccinated -- including a child who died. Last week, 3 cases were reported in Bergen County. New Jersey.

CBS News New York has learned both New York patients -- an infant and a child from New York City -- have since recovered. Health officials say there is no connection between the cases, which speaks to how quickly it can spread. ""One infected person can infect 15 other people,"" said Dr. Tsoline Kojaoghlanian, of the Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Maimonides Health.

Vaccination rates among 2-year-olds in the state are at 81%.

As for the 2 New York City cases, Dr. Julian Watkins, an assistant commissioner of the city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said, ""One of the patients is an infant, and so wasn't eligible to get their 1st vaccine, which is an important reminder for folks that there are vulnerable populations such as those unvaccinated infants.""

""Really, community care and looking out for each other, and knowing that we have a responsibility to each other, feels an important part of the conversation, as well. The proof is in the numbers, and we see the evidence of how these vaccines are effective,"" Watkins added.

A fines de febrero, una comunicaci√≥n epidemiol√≥gica oficial reportaba cuatro casos de sarampi√≥n en la Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires y ya se hab√≠a emitido una alerta a principio de mes por la enfermedad.

Hoy, el ministro de Salud bonaerense, Nicol√°s Kreplak, dio a conocer que se confirmaron otros cuatro casos positivos en la Provincia y se elevan a ocho en total de contagiados en el √Årea Metropolitana de Buenos Aires (AMBA).

La enfermedad que parec√≠a erradicada y que se puede prevenir con vacunas, se expande. En ese contexto, la situaci√≥n sanitaria se complejiza en el pa√≠s.

‚ÄúLos nuevos casos corresponden a una persona adulta sin registro de vacunaci√≥n, a un beb√© menor de un a√±o, y dos adolescentes de 16 y 19 a√±os con antecedentes de vacunaci√≥n. Todos vinculados a la cadena de transmisi√≥n del primer caso‚Äù, hab√≠a dicho el funcionario a trav√©s de su cuenta de X.

Seg√∫n hizo saber p√∫blicamente el ministro, es imperioso y urgente que el Estado Nacional tome medidas e invierta en los recursos para contener el avance del brote. ‚ÄúCon estos ocho casos de sarampi√≥n la situaci√≥n se vuelve cada vez m√°s dif√≠cil¬ª, postul√≥.

En la zona de residencia de estos casos, se hab√≠a realizado el control de foco y bloqueo para identificar los contactos y evitar nuevos contagios.

El primer caso de 2025 se detect√≥ a fines de enero cuando se confirm√≥ la infecci√≥n en una ni√±a de seis a√±os con antecedente de viaje junto a su grupo familiar desde Rusia con escalas en Vietnam, Emiratos √Årabes y Brasil.

La detecci√≥n de un cuarto caso a fines de febrero, en un chico de 18 a√±os y sin antecedentes de viaje, activ√≥ una serie de medidas sanitarias con el objetivo de contener la propagaci√≥n del virus en la comunidad en esa zona.

Para mantener bajo control el sarampi√≥n y prevenir la reintroducci√≥n del virus, es fundamental que la poblaci√≥n mantenga actualizados sus esquemas de vacunaci√≥n. Todos los ni√±os desde el a√±o de vida deben tener el esquema completo seg√∫n el Calendario Nacional de Vacunaci√≥n.

Se recomienda a la poblaci√≥n que revise su estado de vacunaci√≥n, especialmente antes de viajar. Adem√°s, ante cualquier sospecha de sarampi√≥n, se debe notificar inmediatamente a la autoridad sanitaria y seguir las pautas establecidas para la recolecci√≥n de muestras y el aislamiento del paciente.

Chickenpox [Varicella] season is once again active in the State [Kerala] and with most children engaged with exams and many preparing to write various entrance examinations, parents are going through anxious times.

What used to be predominantly a childhood disease is now seen in many adolescents and in adults, with various complications. Hence medical experts have advised that it is better that anyone who has not been exposed to natural infection in childhood get vaccinated.
Chickenpox is an acute and highly contagious disease caused by the varicella zoster virus, primarily affecting children at a young age. The virus spreads through the respiratory route and through personal contact.

In children, it presents as a rash with fever and is a mild disease. But in infants, adolescents, adults, elderly, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised, the risk for a more severe disease and higher incidence of complications is high.

After the primary infection, the varicella virus can remain dormant, as latent infection, in the body and resurface as shingles as age advances and cell-mediated immunity goes down.

Cases usually start getting reported in the State from October and the incidence usually peaks between January-April every year. Every year, Kerala reports anywhere from 3000 cases upwards. In 2019, about 29 583 cases and 20 deaths were reported.

For an infection with an attack rate of around 90% (proportion of people who get infected after being exposed to someone with chickenpox), huge numbers of cases are expected. But it is the rise in fatalities and increase in hospitalisations following complications such as encephalitis, pneumonia, sepsis and secondary bacterial infections that worry health authorities.

Vaccination
-----------
""Vaccination against chickenpox is very effective for adults and children. The vaccine is not part of the universal immunisation schedule but it is widely available in all hospitals. I would advise all parents to ensure that their child is vaccinated against chickenpox, especially if the child is being sent to a hostel or outside Kerala for higher studies as the disease is very infectious,"" says I. Riaz, president, Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Kerala chapter.

Including varicella vaccination in the UIP was one of the recommendations given in the State Vaccine Policy (2022) by the Ekbal committee, as a long-term strategy for Kerala.

There is a huge role for post-exposure prophylaxis too in the case of chickenpox, Dr. Riaz points out.

If exposed to a person with chickenpox, a child/adult (other than pregnant women) should be vaccinated against the disease within 5 days. Remember that a person with chickenpox is contagious, from 1 to 2 days prior to the onset of rashes, until all lesions have crusted over. However, the infection is often contracted from the community, with no information regarding the source.

Vaccinated persons might sometimes get modified chicken pox or breakthrough varicella infection, which is mild. But they are also contagious and should remain in isolation till the infectious period is over.

As the risk of complications is high, infected adolescents, adults and immunocompromised persons should be given antiviral therapy, though healthy children may not need it.

Texas cities run short of MMR vaccine as measles outbreak drives demand
-----------------------------------------------------------------
As measles cases continue to grow in Texas and New Mexico, with a second death, an unvaccinated adult, reported on Thursday [6 Mar 2025], some Texas cities are seeing shortages amid soaring demand for the highly effective vaccine and as the top US health official, Robert F Kennedy Jr, sows disinformation and mistrust about vaccines.

[A couple] was picking up medications at their local Walgreens in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday [5 Mar 2025] and decided to ask the pharmacist about getting the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The pharmacist said that they were ""totally out, and she didn't know exactly when they would be getting more,"" the wife said. The couple wanted to get vaccinated because they have followed the outbreak in the news, including the first measles case detected in Austin last week -- an unvaccinated infant who had traveled recently and was not considered part of the wider outbreak of cases.

In addition to keeping themselves safe, the couple wanted to protect their grandchildren and family members with health vulnerabilities. The pharmacist also mentioned that even doctors' offices were ""having a hard time keeping enough vaccines for kids who needed them,"" [the wife] said.

There are now 198 known cases, 23 hospitalizations, and one death from measles in Texas, and 30 known cases and one death in New Mexico.

When customers call Walgreens locations in Austin, they are still able to book appointments for the MMR vaccine, but pharmacists say the doses are out of stock, and that's true all over the city. None of the Austin-area Walgreens had MMR vaccines in stock on Thursday [6 Mar 2025], pharmacists said.

Vaccines at CVS pharmacy locations in Austin were also scarce. At least one pharmacy had a few doses left on a first-come, first-served basis. But at another location, the pharmacist said on Friday [7 Mar 2025], ""Basically, every location within a 30-mile radius is out.""

At least one CVS in Lubbock -- where most of the hospitalized measles patients are being treated -- had also run out of stock on Thursday [6 Mar 2025]. Some pharmacies in Fort Worth also ran out of the vaccines or had just a handful of doses left on Friday.

Pharmacies at H-E-B, the grocery chain, in Austin are now limiting MMR vaccines to those most at risk, including people born before 1989 who may have only received one dose.

The distributor at Walgreens temporarily ran low on MMR vaccines ""due to the spike in demand,"" said Carly Kaplan, director of pharmacy communications at Walgreens. But ""additional shipments have been arriving this week,"" Kaplan said.

""We're seeing increased demand for the MMR vaccine, but we do still have doses available across our Texas pharmacies and clinics,"" said Amy Thibault, lead director of external communications at CVS Pharmacy. ""We're working to get additional vaccine to Texas as quickly as possible.""

Because measles is such an infectious disease, and the outbreak is already so advanced, it's difficult to trace contacts and conduct ring vaccinations, said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Instead, officials should focus on ""getting the word out about the importance of vaccinating"" and countering misinformation about home remedies, like vitamins, that don't prevent measles, Hotez said. In areas with lower vaccination rates, ""measles can accelerate,"" Hotez said. ""Measles is a great exploiter of unvaccinated and undervaccinated populations.""

Williamson county, which contains the northern part of Austin, had a 94.87% rate of MMR vaccination among kindergartners in 2023, according to data from the Texas department of health and human services. That's close to the 95% goal that creates population immunity, also called herd immunity, which protects those who are too young to be vaccinated or who don't respond well to vaccines because they are immune compromised. But Travis county, which contains most of Austin, had a rate of 89.61% in 2023, down from 95.5% in 2020.

The anti-vaccine movement started in the early 2000s and picked up steam in the 2010s, but vaccine hesitancy really surged during the COVID pandemic.

""Now you're seeing it spill over, once again, into childhood immunizations,"" Hotez said. In Texas, ""we've had a steep rise in personal belief exemption requests -- now we're getting over 100 000.""

To halt the outbreak, Hotez said, officials need to stage a major vaccination campaign, ""both in terms of setting up vaccine clinics and making them accessible and doing the necessary advocacy around it.""

Experts from the CDC arrived in Texas on Tuesday and Wednesday [4-5 Mar 2025], a CDC spokesperson said. The agency has provided 2000 doses of the MMR vaccine to officials in Texas and neighboring jurisdictions, and ""[the] CDC continues to recommend the MMR vaccine as the best way to prevent measles for children and adults,"" the spokesperson said.

But the agency's advice on vaccines now diverges from past approaches to infectious disease outbreaks in a key way: ""The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,"" the CDC spokesperson said.

One in 5 unvaccinated measles patients usually need to be hospitalized, and nearly one-fifth of children develop pneumonia. One in 600 babies who are not yet eligible for vaccines suffer from a fatal neurological complication, and about one in 1000 children develop encephalitis, or brain swelling, which can lead to seizures and loss of hearing and intellectual disabilities. Measles can also cause immune amnesia, where patients' immune systems ""forget"" previous infections and vaccinations.

Texas atraviesa un brote de sarampi√≥n, el m√°s grande en 30 a√±os, con m√°s de 150 casos conformados hasta esta semana. Las leyes que permiten a los padres decidir sobre la vacunaci√≥n de los ni√±os y un fuerte arraigo de comunidades religiosas han sido se√±alados como factores que han agravado la crisis.

Entre la poblaci√≥n menonita que habita en la regi√≥n oeste se ha fortalecido el movimiento antivacunas, a pesar de que la religi√≥n no prohibe expresamente este procedimiento. Ya que este grupo religioso no env√≠a a sus hijos a escuelas p√∫blicas, no est√°n sujetos al requisito de vacunaci√≥n que debe acatarse cuando los alumnos ingresan al nivel de k√≠nder.

La postura del secretario de Salud, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., tambi√©n ha sido duramente criticada. El pol√≠tico escribi√≥ una columna de opini√≥n donde aceptaba el valor de las vacunas pero animaba a los padres a hablar de alternativas de tratamiento con sus m√©dicos.

Los legisladores estatales presentaron este a√±o m√°s de 10 proyectos de ley que fortalecer√≠an o ampliar√≠an las exenciones de vacunas, que Texas ya permite por ‚Äúrazones de conciencia, incluida una creencia religiosa‚Äù.

Statement from the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada on the increase in measles cases and the risk to people in Canada
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Measles cases on the rise: protect yourself and your family
-----------------------------------------------------------
In 2024, we saw a sharp increase in measles cases globally compared to 2023. In Canada this concerning trend has continued with more cases reported in the first 2 months of 2025 than in all of 2024 due to a noticeable increase in cases associated with outbreaks in New Brunswick, Ontario, Qu√©bec and Manitoba.

As of March 6, 2025, Canada has recorded 227 measles cases in 2025, many requiring hospitalization. The majority of cases are unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children who have been exposed in their communities, such as in social events, daycares, schools and healthcare settings. Measles is very contagious and can cause serious illness, with complications including pneumonia, deafness, brain inflammation, and, in severe cases, death.

Cases can also occur when unvaccinated individuals travel to or from areas where measles is circulating. In recent months, there have been measles cases in Ontario, Qu√©bec and British Columbia that occurred because travellers were exposed to measles in another country. As we move through spring break travel season, I am concerned that the global rise in measles cases, combined with declining vaccination rates among school-aged children in Canada, could lead to more illness and more community transmission.

I strongly urge all Canadians to ensure they are vaccinated against measles -- check to see if you are up-to-date before travelling. If needed, the vaccine should be administered at least 2 weeks before departure, but even last-minute vaccinations offer protection.

High vaccination rates are particularly important for measles, given how contagious it is. For people who are not immune to measles from vaccination or previous infection, over 90% of those exposed to the virus will become infected. Those at higher risk include children under 5, adults over 20, pregnant individuals, and immunocompromised individuals.

Travel precautions and vaccination recommendations
--------------------------------------------------
A travel health notice‚ÄØfor measles is currently in place for all countries. Consult it for recommendations on how to protect yourself and your family from measles when travelling abroad.

Before travelling, ensure the following:
- Infants (6 to 12 months old) travelling to high-risk areas receive an early measles vaccine dose -- consult a healthcare provider for guidance.
- Children and adolescents receive both doses of a measles-containing vaccine.
- Adults born in 1970 or later receive both doses of a measles-containing vaccine.
- Those born before 1970 receive one dose if not immune, particularly if travelling to an area with active transmission.

Recognizing and responding to measles symptoms
----------------------------------------------
If you are travelling this spring, remain vigilant for measles symptoms. Measles typically starts with fever; red, watery eyes; runny nose; and cough, followed by a red rash that spreads from the face to the rest of the body.

If you suspect you have measles while travelling in or returning to Canada:
- Wear a well-fitting medical mask and minimize contact with others.
- Inform a flight attendant, cruise staff, or border services officer upon arrival.

If symptoms develop:
- Call a healthcare provider immediately before going anywhere (such as a doctor's office, emergency room, pharmacy, etc.) so that they can provide advice while minimizing the risk of exposure for other people.

Stay protected: get vaccinated
------------------------------
With measles cases rising worldwide and in Canada, keeping up with routine vaccinations is more critical than ever. Measles vaccination is highly effective in limiting transmission and preventing severe outcomes. If you are unsure of your vaccination status, check with your healthcare provider or local public health unit.

By staying vigilant and working together to increase measles vaccine coverage, we can prevent outbreaks and keep our communities safe against this preventable disease. The measles vaccine is the best way to protect you and your family.

The Virginia Department of Health has confirmed a case of measles with potential exposure to anyone who may have visited Washington Dulles International Airport on March 5 [2025]. The confirmed case was an individual who was returning from international travel.

According to health officials, you may have been exposed if you were in Terminal A, on transportation to the main terminal or in the baggage claim area of Dulles International Airport between 4 pm and 9 pm on Wednesday [5 Mar 2025]. Health officials are coordinating an effort to identify people who might have been exposed, including contacting potentially exposed passengers on specific flights.

Measles is a highly contagious illness that can spread easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. Virginia has high vaccination rates with approximately 95% of kindergarteners fully vaccinated against measles.

Two deaths have been reported from measles due to an outbreak in Texas and New Mexico: an unvaccinated adult from Lea County, New Mexico, and an unvaccinated 6-year-old in Lubbock, Texas. The deaths are the first measles fatalities since 2015. More than 200 cases have been reported in the 2 states.

US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pushed anti-vaccine treatments including the use of vitamin A in the past. In an interview with Fox News this week, Kennedy endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A, according to an article by CNN.

However, doctors warn that following that advice could have dire consequences. The supplement may be harmful to children in large doses, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. ""I'm very concerned about the messaging that's coming out,"" Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, chief of infectious diseases at Children's Health in Dallas, told Reuters. ""It's somewhat baffling to me that we're relitigating the effectiveness of vaccines and alternative therapies. We know how to handle measles. We've had 6 decades of experience.""

Kennedy told Fox that a vaccination for measles is a ""personal choice."" ""At this point, we are recommending that people in those [undervaccinated] communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not, and we're going to try to make sure that they're taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them,"" Kennedy said.

A positive case of measles was reported in a Maryland resident who recently traveled internationally, the Maryland Department of Health confirmed on Sunday [9 Mar 2025]. The state's Department of Health said the resident resides in Howard County, but the case is not associated with the measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico 

The state is working on locating people who may have been exposed, which includes travelers at Terminal A, on the transportation to the main terminal, and in the baggage claim area, between 4 pm and 9 pm on March 5, 2025.

Measles symptoms typically develop 10 to 14 days after exposure to the virus but can develop as soon as 7 days and as long as 21 days after exposure.

""It is one of the most infectious diseases that we have,"" said Dr. Lucia Donatelli, Center for Immunization, Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Outbreak Response Bureau for the Maryland Department of Health. ""So, there's a 90% secondary attack rate, we're not fully immunized against measles, there is a 90% chance that if you're exposed that you will contract measles, so that's why it's so important for everybody to be vaccinated against measles.""

People are generally immune to measles if they've had the 2 vaccine shots, previously had the virus, or were born in the United States before 1957.

Anyone who visited the following locations during any of the following hours may have been exposed:
- Washington Dulles International Airport: Terminal A, on transportation to the main terminal, and in the baggage claim area, between 4 pm and 9 pm on March 5, 2025.
- Johns Hopkins Howard County Medical Center Pediatric Emergency Department, between 3:30 pm and 7:30 pm on March 7, 2025.

Measles cases do occur sporadically in Maryland; the most recent cases are one case of measles identified in Maryland in 2024, one in 2023, and no cases from 2020-2022.

The Health Secretariat of Mexico has issued an epidemiological alert following the record of 133 confirmed cases of pertussis in 21 entities in the country during 2025. The first death from this disease was reported, a 1.5-year-old infant. This death of a 1.5-year-old infant was reported in Nuevo Leon, and it is also reported that pertussis is mainly affecting newborns.

Although this disease mainly affects children and adolescents, it can also be transmitted to adults, so it is vital that precautions are taken if it is detected. According to data presented by the Health Secretariat, in our country more than 100 [new?] cases of pertussis have been recorded, divided into 21 entities, of which the most reported cases are:
- Nuevo Leon, 35
- Mexico City, 13
- Aguascalientes, 11
- Oaxaca, 10

Furthermore, the authority indicates that there are 460 probable cases in the country, with the capital (73), Nuevo Leon (56) and Baja California (44) being the states with the highest incidence.

<https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/779373-parents-fume-as-diphtheria-ravages-kings-college-lagos.html>


Parents of students in King's College, Lagos (KCL), are worried over reports of a suspected Diphtheria outbreak in the school that led to the hospitalisation of some students.

The parents who spoke in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Lagos blamed the outbreak on the unsanitary condition of the school.

A parent who pleaded anonymity faulted the school's management for its seeming silence and not swinging into action promptly in the face of the outbreak.

The parent said, ""If there are no cases, why are the students mandated to wear nose masks and some of them taken to Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) for treatment?

""There were cases late last year.

""We heard that officials of the World Health Organisation (WHO) were in the school yesterday (8 Mar 2025), to sensitise the students on preventive measures against diphtheria disease.

""Why is the school secretive about the issue?

""Parents had complained several times about the poor environmental sanitation of the school and toilets, including food given to the students.

""Students even complain about some members of the food committee and what they do.

""A few weeks ago, some parents raised concerns that their children had fallen sick and were diagnosed with diphtheria at the hospital.

""Even, some PTA Exco don't like parents to openly complain about such.

""Last week, the school sent a message to parents to sign a consent form that would enable their children to receive diphtheria vaccines in the school premises.""

A copy of the consent form obtained by NAN showed that the routine immunisation was done by the school in collaboration with the Lagos State Primary Health Care Board through Eti-Osa Local Government.

Another parent lamented about the state of the college clinic, stressing the need for a medical doctor to be consulting there regularly, for it to operate optimally.

Two other parents who spoke with NAN affirmed that in December [2024], their sons were hospitalised and treated for diphtheria.

""It was by God's grace that my son survived.

""I was called to pick him up. He complained of sore throat. His neck was swollen and he had high fever.

""When we got to the hospital, he was on admission for over a week.

""In fact, there was another student who was hospitalised for same ailment the same time, but he didn't pull through,"" one of the parents said.

She called for intensified preventive measures to be put in place in KCL and other schools and the students to be constantly sensitised.

""These are still children, most of them restless and full of play.

""They need constant supervision especially in their toilet, washing and also eating and recreational habits.""

The parents urged the federal government to improve infrastructure, especially water and WASH facilities, teaching quality, teachers/ staff attitude, and educational standards in the college and other colleges across the country.

A relative whose nephew was among those taken to LUTH for treatment on Saturday [8 Mar 2025], told NAN, ""Let's keep praying for the children.

""My sister is panicking and distraught especially since she heard a student died from the disease in December [2024].

""I believe that all will be well.

""However, the federal government and the school's management should look more into improving the standards of KCL and, indeed, all unity schools.

""The PTA should work to better the lot of schools and students and not cover up things that aren't right.

""These schools are very good and should not be allowed to continuously fall below standards all around"".

Reacting, the Public Relations Officer, King's College Parents Teachers Association (PRO, KCPTA), Ngozi Ogbonna, in a message to parents, called for calm, assuring that efforts were ongoing to control the situation.

Mrs Ogbonna in her message titled, ""Issue of Diphtheria Disease in Annex Campus, King's College"", said the college management and PTA EXCO are collaborating to address the situation.

""As part of their efforts, the management and PTA EXCO met and contacted the relevant government health agencies, who, in collaboration, advised that booster doses of vaccines should be administered to the students.

""However, some of the students who manifested symptoms have been isolated, taken to LUTH for diagnosis and results awaited.

""Other students who manifest symptoms subsequently would be taken to LUTH accordingly, and parents contacted for follow-up.

""Delegates of the World Health Organisation visited the Annex Campus this evening to play their own role in controlling the situation.

""On this note, we, therefore, implore parents to remain calm and prayerful as everything is under control.

""We shall overcome,"" Mrs Ogbonna said in her message.

According to WHO, diphtheria is a contagious disease that is caused by toxin-producing bacteria. It can spread from person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

The diphtheria toxin damages the respiratory tract and can spread throughout the body. Common symptoms include fever, sore throat, and swelling of the neck glands.

Diphtheria can affect anyone but is most common in unvaccinated children.

The health agency said overcrowding in residential camps increases the risk of infection, emphasising that the risk of complications or death decreases considerably if appropriate treatment is provided early in the course of illness.

On prevention, WHO said diphtheria can be prevented by vaccines that are often given in combination with tetanus and pertussis and other diseases.

It recommends giving a total of 6 diphtheria-containing vaccine doses starting at 6 weeks of age through adolescence to provide long-term protection.

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) said the country continues to grapple with a diphtheria outbreak.

NCDC said that 41 336 suspected cases of diphtheria were reported from 37 states between Epidemiological Week 19, 2022, and Epidemiological Week 4, 2025.

 Two children in Quang Nam die, health sector warns of measles epidemic
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Two children, 8 and 10 years old, in Nam Tra My district, Quang Nam, died after a week of high fever and rash. The Ministry of Health assessed that it was ""highly likely related to measles"" and warned against the epidemic.
 
 
 
 On the morning of 11 Mar 2025, the Ministry of Health recorded the above, in the context of monitoring in Nam Tra My district since the end of January [2025] until now, discovering 255 cases of rash fever suspected of measles, similar to the symptoms of these 2 children.
 
 
 
 According to epidemiological investigation, the 2 deceased children were students at Tra Don Primary Boarding School. The 8-year-old child had cough, high fever, and diarrhea since 26 Feb 2025 and stayed home from school. Village health workers and teachers went to the house to persuade the family to take the child to the commune health station for examination, but the family did not go and stayed home to pray. A few days later, the child vomited, could not eat or drink, became exhausted, and died on 5 Mar 2025. Currently, the health of the family members is stable, with no symptoms related to the disease.
 
 
 
 The 10-year-old child had cough, fever, and diarrhea since 2 Mar 2025. His family did not take him to the hospital. The child became exhausted and died on 9 Mar 2025.
 
  
 
 The health sector monitored Nam Tra My district from 25 Jan to 10 Mar 2025, recording 255 cases of fever with rash. Of these, 149 children have recovered, 104 children are being treated at medical facilities in the area, conscious, fever reduced but still coughing.
 
 
 
 Nam Tra My District Medical Center coordinated with the Provincial Center for Disease Control (CDC) to send samples for testing, and the results showed that 19 cases tested positive for measles.
 
 
 
 ""The 2 children who died are highly likely to be related to measles,"" the Ministry of Health said, citing the locality where many cases tested positive for measles and the recent increase in measles cases in some localities. However, preliminary investigations have shown that these cases are not epidemiologically related to each other.
 
 
 
 According to regulations, cases of fever with rash are considered ""suspected measles"" even though these are typical symptoms of measles. ""Suspected"" cases are only recorded as having measles if they test positive for the measles virus.
 
 
 
 The health sector of Quang Nam province and the Pasteur Institute of Nha Trang are implementing measures to prevent and control the epidemic. It is forecasted that there may continue to be suspected measles cases in the coming time because Nam Tra My district is a mountainous district, mainly ethnic minorities or scattered in highland areas, difficult travel conditions, and backward customs such as worshiping when sick.
 
 
 
 Vaccination and health care for people in the above communes are currently a challenge for the health sector. According to the Ministry of Health, during the COVID-19 epidemic 4 years ago, many children here were not fully vaccinated against measles. The prolonged vaccine shortage in 2023 also affected the vaccination rate among children in the area, creating an immunity gap in the community. The new vaccination campaign was launched in March 2025, and currently, Nam Tra My district has vaccinated nearly 50%.
 
 
 
 The health sector has activated the epidemic prevention system, established a rapid response mobile team to support Nam Tra My district in fighting the epidemic, promptly detected sick children and mobilized their families to take them to the medical station for isolation and treatment. The outbreaks have been isolated to prevent them from spreading to other localities. At the same time, the authorities are reviewing to organize measles vaccination for children.
 
 
 
 Family members are also instructed to isolate and provide medical care for the patient for 7 days from the onset of the rash. Mild cases are isolated at home (absent from school, work, or group activities or large gatherings). If the disease worsens or there are signs of complications, treatment and isolation at a medical facility is required. During the isolation period, the patient must wear a medical mask.
 
 
 
 Measles is transmitted through the respiratory tract by coughing, sneezing, close contact with infected people or nasal secretions. The disease is characterized by fever, inflammation of the respiratory tract, conjunctivitis and rash. Children with measles mostly recover on their own, but some groups such as immunodeficiency, cancer, chronic diseases, congenital heart disease are at risk of severe progression, possibly death. Children with measles often have long-term reduced immunity , are susceptible to malnutrition and other diseases later.
 
 
 
 In 2024, measles appeared locally in many localities, increasing more than 100 times compared to 2023. Ho Chi Minh City announced a measles epidemic in the 2nd half of last year [2024] to focus on vaccination, however, due to population fluctuations and the high rate of unvaccinated children in schools, the city has not yet controlled measles and has not been able to declare the end of the epidemic. In the context of the epidemic, the age of measles vaccination has been expanded to children 6 months of age and older, instead of 9 months of age as before.

 Outbreak confirmed in Mennonite camps in Western Chihuahua
 
 ----------------------------------------
 
 Authorities in Chihuahua, Mexico, say they have confirmed 15 measles cases in a Mennonite community in the western portion of the state. A 16th case has been confirmed in the city of Namiquipa.
 
 
 
 ""We don't have any cases in Juarez; the cases we have are (near) Cuauhtemoc,"" said Dr. Rogelio Covarrubias, director in Juarez of the Chihuahua Health Department. ""We are not on alert, we have not declared an emergency, but we are concerned, and we are working hard because measles can spread anywhere in the state.""
 
 
 
 Most cases were detected in the Mennonite camps north of Cuauhtemoc, which is 270 miles [434 km], or a 5-hour drive, south of El Paso, Texas. Chihuahua health authorities believe residents who have family in Texas or who traveled there to acquire farming implements carried the illness back home. They are concerned because they don't have an accurate count of how many adults in the Mennonite camps are immunized against measles. Children enrolled in Mexican schools typically get the vaccine.
 
 
 
 West Texas and New Mexico communities have reported more than 250 cases, and 2 unvaccinated individuals have died from measles-related causes, according to The Associated Press; 29 people in Texas have been hospitalized due to the illness on Tuesday [11 Mar 2025].
 
 
 
 Covarrubias said Chihuahua health authorities communicate regularly with their counterparts in El Paso when it comes to measles and other communicable diseases.
 
 
 
 ""We have good communication with the El Paso Health Department and the (Mexican) consulate in El Paso to learn of possible cases in El Paso and among those who come to Juarez to visit family,"" he said.
 
 
 
 El Paso health officials are aware of the situation in western Chihuahua and encourage residents on both sides of the border to make sure they and their family members are vaccinated. ""We know that for infectious diseases or any other diseases there are no borders. So, whatever affects our region is going to be affecting either side of the border,"" said Paso City-County Health Authority Dr. Hector I. Ocaranza. He said El Paso and Juarez not only have a good working relationship on health issues, but also share best practices.
 
 
 
 ""We know the Mennonites are a very mobile community, and we know they are going to be crossing through El Paso -- and El Paso is a big travel hub for not just the Mennonites but many people -- so that's why we're expecting to see cases of measles here in El Paso, because of the close proximity that we have in the west part of Texas and east part of New Mexico,"" Ocaranza said.
 
 
 
 Several El Paso residents work in West Texas oil fields and return home on weekends or whenever their rotation period ends; many El Pasoans cross the border into Juarez to spend time with their extended family in Mexico as well, Ocaranza said. However, as of Wednesday [12 Mar 2025], neither El Paso nor Juarez had reported a single confirmed case of the measles.
 
 
 
 ""We are all in very close communication. We all have been preparing in case some of these cases appear here in El Paso or Juarez,"" Ocaranza said. ""We are very happy to also provide vaccination to people regardless of their immigration status. Our clinics have always been known to be available to anybody. Whatever we can do to protect our community and our region's population is going to be the way we are going to continue to participate in these preventive activities.""

 It has been discovered that a healthcare worker at Nepean Hospital's Birth Unit was infectious with hepatitis B between 2013 and 2024. Officials warned that 223 women who gave birth at the hospital may have had a ""potential low-risk exposure."" NSW Health has also reviewed the care of 143 children.
 
 
 
 Patients who had certain procedures performed by the affected healthcare worker will be contacted. The procedures include episiotomy, repairs for episiotomy or perineal/vaginal tear, or application for foetal scalp electrodes (mother and baby). NSW Health said it had worked with the healthcare worker to remove any further risk of transmission to patients. The potential for exposure is low risk, according to NSW Health.
 
 
 
 ""Nepean Blue Mountains Local Health District understands hearing this may cause concern within our community, and to those directly impacted, for this we extend our sincerest apologies,"" NSW Health said in a statement. ""The NSW Health Blood Borne Viruses Advisory Panel has reviewed the care provided by the healthcare worker and determined the risk of transmission is low for 223 women and 143 children.
 
 
 
 ""As a precaution, NBMLHD is offering free assessment and testing for hepatitis B for those women and children who may have been at risk. All patients who are coming to Nepean Hospital for birthing services can be assured that staff strive to provide high-quality care in safe birthing environments.""
 
 
 
 NSW Health Minister Ryan Park apologised on behalf of NSW health. ""We understand people are concerned,"" he told 2GB radio. ""I would be, if it were my wife or my child, I understand that. That is why we want to move as quickly and effectively as we can. I understand people are concerned, and we apologize for that.""
 
 
 
 Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus. According to NSW Health, it can be transmitted during birth, during sex, and through blood-to-blood contact. Hepatitis B is detected by a blood test that can show if a person has current infection or has had hepatitis B in the past and is no longer infectious. The best protection from hepatitis B is vaccination.
 
 
 
 Testing is important as there are now treatments available to prevent long-term complications of hepatitis B, and precautions can be taken to prevent the spread of infection to others.

 Long Island baby tests positive for measles -- and 12 more may have been exposed, officials warn
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 
 A Long Island baby tested positive for measles as health officials issued an ominous warning Wednesday [12 Mar 2025] that at least 12 more people may have been exposed to the virus. The child, who is under a year old, had been treated at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park earlier in March [2025] -- and now the state Health Department fears ""there was potential exposure to measles for the public"" at the facility.
 
 
 
 As of Wednesday afternoon, 12 Long Island residents at Cohen were potentially exposed, News12 reported.
 
 
 
 ""We are actively working with public health officials under established exposure protocols to ensure no further cases arise from this incident,"" a Cohen Children's Medical Center spokesperson said.
 
 
 
 The state DOH recommended that anyone who visited Cohen's pediatric emergency department between 3 and 4 Mar [2025] or saw an inpatient child within the hospital's Medicine 3 unit from 3 to 6 Mar [2025] may also be at risk of exposure.
 
 
 
 The young child was ineligible for a measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine due to their young age, Suffolk County Health Commissioner Dr. Gregson Pigott told the outlet. He added that the county's high vaccination rate will help prevent potential spread.
 
 
 
 The toddler, who is recovering at home, is believed to have contracted measles while traveling.

 Two children, 8 and 10 years old, in Nam Tra My district, Quang Nam, died after a week of high fever and rash. The Ministry of Health assessed that it was ""highly likely related to measles"" and warned against the epidemic.
 
 
 
 On the morning of 11 Mar 2025, the Ministry of Health recorded the above, in the context of monitoring in Nam Tra My district since the end of January [2025] until now, discovering 255 cases of rash fever suspected of measles, similar to the symptoms of these 2 children.
 
 
 
 According to epidemiological investigation, the 2 deceased children were students at Tra Don Primary Boarding School. The 8-year-old child had cough, high fever, and diarrhea since 26 Feb 2025 and stayed home from school. Village health workers and teachers went to the house to persuade the family to take the child to the commune health station for examination, but the family did not go and stayed home to pray. A few days later, the child vomited, could not eat or drink, became exhausted, and died on 5 Mar 2025. Currently, the health of the family members is stable, with no symptoms related to the disease.
 
 
 
 The 10-year-old child had cough, fever, and diarrhea since 2 Mar 2025. His family did not take him to the hospital. The child became exhausted and died on 9 Mar 2025.
 
  
 
 The health sector monitored Nam Tra My district from 25 Jan to 10 Mar 2025, recording 255 cases of fever with rash. Of these, 149 children have recovered, 104 children are being treated at medical facilities in the area, conscious, fever reduced but still coughing.
 
 
 
 Nam Tra My District Medical Center coordinated with the Provincial Center for Disease Control (CDC) to send samples for testing, and the results showed that 19 cases tested positive for measles.
 
 
 
 ""The 2 children who died are highly likely to be related to measles,"" the Ministry of Health said, citing the locality where many cases tested positive for measles and the recent increase in measles cases in some localities. However, preliminary investigations have shown that these cases are not epidemiologically related to each other.
 
 
 
 According to regulations, cases of fever with rash are considered ""suspected measles"" even though these are typical symptoms of measles. ""Suspected"" cases are only recorded as having measles if they test positive for the measles virus.
 
 
 
 The health sector of Quang Nam province and the Pasteur Institute of Nha Trang are implementing measures to prevent and control the epidemic. It is forecasted that there may continue to be suspected measles cases in the coming time because Nam Tra My district is a mountainous district, mainly ethnic minorities or scattered in highland areas, difficult travel conditions, and...customs such as worshiping when sick.
 
 
 
 Vaccination and health care for people in the above communes are currently a challenge for the health sector. According to the Ministry of Health, during the COVID-19 epidemic 4 years ago, many children here were not fully vaccinated against measles. The prolonged vaccine shortage in 2023 also affected the vaccination rate among children in the area, creating an immunity gap in the community. The new vaccination campaign was launched in March 2025, and currently, Nam Tra My district has vaccinated nearly 50%.
 
 
 
 The health sector has activated the epidemic prevention system, established a rapid response mobile team to support Nam Tra My district in fighting the epidemic, promptly detected sick children and mobilized their families to take them to the medical station for isolation and treatment. The outbreaks have been isolated to prevent them from spreading to other localities. At the same time, the authorities are reviewing to organize measles vaccination for children.
 
 
 
 Family members are also instructed to isolate and provide medical care for the patient for 7 days from the onset of the rash. Mild cases are isolated at home (absent from school, work, or group activities or large gatherings). If the disease worsens or there are signs of complications, treatment and isolation at a medical facility is required. During the isolation period, the patient must wear a medical mask.
 
 
 
 Measles is transmitted through the respiratory tract by coughing, sneezing, close contact with infected people or nasal secretions. The disease is characterized by fever, inflammation of the respiratory tract, conjunctivitis and rash. Children with measles mostly recover on their own, but some groups such as immunodeficiency, cancer, chronic diseases, congenital heart disease are at risk of severe progression, possibly death. Children with measles often have long-term reduced immunity, are susceptible to malnutrition and other diseases later.
 
 
 
 In 2024, measles appeared locally in many localities, increasing more than 100 times compared to 2023. Ho Chi Minh City announced a measles epidemic in the 2nd half of last year [2024] to focus on vaccination, however, due to population fluctuations and the high rate of unvaccinated children in schools, the city has not yet controlled measles and has not been able to declare the end of the epidemic. In the context of the epidemic, the age of measles vaccination has been expanded to children 6 months of age and older, instead of 9 months of age as before.

 The Kansas Department of Health and Environment and the Stevens County Health Department have confirmed a measles case in a Stevens County resident. It is unclear whether this case is linked to any ongoing outbreaks in the United States. State and local health officials are notifying those who may have been exposed.
 
 
 
 This is the first measles case in Kansas since 2018. Measles symptoms usually appear 10 to 14 days after exposure, though they can develop as early as 7 days or as late as 21 days, the state says. Early symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough and red eyes, followed by a rash. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said in a news release that the best way to prevent measles is to get the MMR vaccine.
 
 
 
 Stevens County is about 400 miles from the Kansas City metro area.

 2025 Measles Outbreak Guidance
 
 ------------------------------
 
 The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is so contagious, additional cases are likely to occur in Lea County and the surrounding communities. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays by noon Mountain Time if there are new cases to report.
 
 
 
 Total cases: 35
 
 Vaccinated with at least one dose: 2
 
 Not vaccinated: 28
 
 Unknown: 5

 Age ranges of measles cases
 
 0-4 years: 5
 
 5-17 years: 10
 
 18+ years: 19
 
 Pending: 1
 
 Total: 35
 
 
 
 Measles is primarily a disease of people who are not immunized and most residents in the outbreak area are protected from measles disease even if they are exposed to the virus. We expect to continue to identify new measles infections associated with this regional outbreak in New Mexico and Texas. This is not the explosive situation that we see with a pandemic where the population is unprotected. The measles cases that we have confirmed include persons with positive laboratory tests and persons who developed measles symptoms at the appropriate time following contact with a confirmed case. These cases were identified in the course of careful (epidemiologic) investigations. The newly added cases include people who were ill previously and were not identified until after their illness. The timing of rash onset for the current 35 cases shows them to be spread out over time and are not increasing dramatically:
 
 Week 1 (9-15 Feb 2025): 14
 
 Week 2 (16-22 Feb 2025): 6
 
 Week 3 (23 Feb-1 Mar 2025): 8
 
 Week 4 (2-8 Mar 2025): 6
 
 Week 5 (9-15 Mar 2025): 1

 The Paris-Lamar County Health District has identified 4 confirmed cases of measles in ages ranging from 5 months to adult age. These individuals traveled to Gaines County during the measles outbreak. The individuals were not vaccinated. The Paris-Lamar County Health District (PLCHD) is investigating cases and will continue to investigate cases that come in.
 
 
 
 The Health District, with the support of (DSHS) Region 4/5, is actively investigating the cases and conducting contact tracing to identify possible exposures and limit further spread of the disease. Due to the highly contagious nature of measles, additional cases may occur, especially in unvaccinated people.
 
 
 
 ""Measles is a serious yet preventable disease,"" said Dr. Amanda Green, PLCHD local health authority. ""Staying up to date on vaccinations is the most effective way to safeguard yourself, your loved ones, and the community from this highly contagious illness. With these recent cases, it's more important than ever to ensure your immunizations are current.""

 Measles Outbreak - March 14, 2025
 
 ---------------------------------
 
 The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is reporting an outbreak of measles in the South Plains and Panhandle regions of Texas. At this time, 259 cases have been identified since late January 2025. Thirty-four of the patients have been hospitalized.
 
 
 
 There has been 1 fatality in a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area. The child was not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.
 
 
 
 Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.

 -----------------------------------------------------
 
 Unvaccinated/Unknown: 257
 
 Vaccinated, 1 dose: 0
 
 Vaccinated, 2+ doses: 2
 
 
 
 Note: The unvaccinated/unknown category includes people with no documented doses of measles vaccine more than 14 days before symptom onset.
 
 
 
 After additional investigation into the details of individual measles cases, DSHS has determined that 3 cases previously classified as vaccinated were not vaccinated cases. Two of those cases got their vaccine doses 1 to 2 days before their symptoms started, after they had been exposed to the virus. It takes the body about 14 days after vaccination to develop immunity to measles, so people aren't considered vaccinated until that 14-day period has passed.
 
 
 
 DSHS has determined that the third case was a Lubbock County resident who had a vaccine reaction rather than a measles infection based on the results of MeVA testing, which detected the vaccine strain. This case has been removed from the case count entirely. The measles vaccine can occasionally cause a reaction with a rash and fever that mimic measles, but it is not a measles infection and cannot spread to other people.
 
 
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with 2 doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.

 La Secretar√≠a de Salud ha emitido un aviso epidemiol√≥gico ante el incremento de contagios de sarampi√≥n en M√©xico. La notificaci√≥n es un llamado a todas las unidades m√©dicas de primer, segundo y tercer nivel de atenci√≥n para que mantengan medidas de vigilancia y prevenci√≥n con el fin de contener la enfermedad.
 
 
 
 ‚ÄúPara evitar la reintroducci√≥n del virus del sarampi√≥n [en la Rep√∫blica Mexicana], es necesario mantener una adecuada vigilancia epidemiol√≥gica enfocada en la detecci√≥n, notificaci√≥n y diagn√≥stico oportuno de casos probables de sarampi√≥n o rub√©ola. Asimismo, se requiere obtener informaci√≥n epidemiol√≥gica de calidad que oriente las acciones para reforzar la promoci√≥n de la salud, la prevenci√≥n espec√≠fica y el control de la enfermedad‚Äù, indicaron las autoridades sanitarias.
 
 
 
 Hasta el martes 12 de marzo, el Comit√© Nacional para la Vigilancia Epidemiol√≥gica (Conave) ha registrado 416 casos probables. De estos, 22 han sido confirmados: 18 en el estado de Oaxaca y cuatro en Coahuila. El 68% de los pacientes son hombres y el 32% mujeres, con edades entre uno y 19 a√±os. La dependencia federal precis√≥ que la mayor√≠a de los casos se han reportado en la poblaci√≥n de cinco a nueve a√±os, con 11 incidencias.
 
 
 
 ‚ÄúRespecto al antecedente vacunal, se encontr√≥ que el 86% (19) de los casos confirmados no cuenta con antecedente de vacunaci√≥n, mientras que el 9% (2) tiene una dosis y el 4% (1) cuenta con dos dosis documentadas en la Cartilla Nacional de Vacunaci√≥n‚Äù, a√±adi√≥ la dependencia.
 
 
 
 La disminuci√≥n de las tasas de vacunaci√≥n ha provocado el resurgimiento del sarampi√≥n en diversas regiones del mundo. En 2023, la Organizaci√≥n Mundial de la Salud (OMS) contabiliz√≥ 10.3 millones de casos a nivel global, lo que representa un aumento del 20% en comparaci√≥n con el a√±o anterior. Si bien la mayor√≠a de las infecciones se concentraban en √Åfrica, Asia sudoriental, Europa, el Mediterr√°neo oriental y el Pac√≠fico occidental, la enfermedad ha comenzado a expandirse en Am√©rica, donde se han registrado brotes preocupantes en Estados Unidos, Canad√° y Argentina.
 
 
 
 La OMS inform√≥ este mi√©rcoles que los casos de sarampi√≥n en la regi√≥n europea se duplicaron en 2024, alcanzando su nivel m√°s alto en m√°s de 25 a√±os. Los menores de cinco a√±os representaron m√°s del 40% de los m√°s de 127,000 casos registrados en Europa y Asia Central.
 
 
 
 ""El sarampi√≥n ha vuelto y es una llamada de atenci√≥n. Tras un retroceso en la cobertura de inmunizaci√≥n durante la pandemia de covid-19, los casos han aumentado de forma significativa en 2023 y 2024. Las tasas de vacunaci√≥n en muchos pa√≠ses a√∫n no han vuelto a los niveles previos a la crisis sanitaria global"", destac√≥ Hans Kluge, director regional de la OMS para Europa.

 <https://www.medindia.net/news/mumps-outbreak-in-coimbatore-tamil-nadu-health-department-issues-high-alert-219137-1.htm>
 
 
 
 
 
 The Tamil Nadu Health Department has sounded a high alert as mumps cases surge among children in Coimbatore [district]. The alert follows an outbreak at a matriculation school in Peelamedu, where 21 kindergarten students tested positive for the viral infection in the past 2 days.
 
 
 
 In response, the school has declared a holiday until 12 Mar [2025] to prevent further transmission. Health officials from the Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation confirmed that 13 KG students initially displayed symptoms, prompting the school to send them home immediately. Authorities have assured the public that there is no cause for panic but urge individuals with symptoms like fever, facial swelling, or fatigue to seek medical care promptly.
 
 
 
 Mumps is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the paramyxovirus, primarily affecting the salivary glands, especially the parotid glands near the ears, leading to painful swelling on one or both sides of the face. Common symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, loss of appetite, and difficulty chewing or swallowing.
 
 
 
 The virus spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or close contact with an infected person. It is most contagious a few days before symptoms appear and up to 5 days after swelling begins. While mumps is usually a mild illness, it can lead to complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, hearing loss, or inflammation of the testicles or ovaries, particularly in unvaccinated individuals.
 
 
 
 The most effective way to prevent mumps is through vaccination. The MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine is highly effective and is typically administered in 2 doses during childhood. Maintaining good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing, avoiding close contact with infected individuals, and covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, can also help reduce the spread of the virus.
 
 
 
 A recent study by the Tamil Nadu Directorate of Public Health (DPH) reveals a worrying rise in mumps cases statewide. Data from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) shows the incidence rate jumped from 0.07 per lakh [100 000] population in 2021-22 to 1.30 in 2023-24. Over 70% of cases involve children under 9, with Coimbatore and Dharmapuri being hotspots in previous years.
 
 
 
 Health experts attribute the surge to factors like environmental changes, population dynamics, and gaps in vaccination coverage. While India's Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) includes measles and rubella vaccines, mumps vaccination remains optional. The DPH study recommends making mumps a notifiable disease and adding the mumps vaccine to the UIP to curb future outbreaks.
 
 
 
 Authorities are intensifying surveillance and preventive measures, urging parents to ensure their children are vaccinated and to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms arise.

 Ernakulam [district in Kerala state] reported 220 hepatitis A cases between 1 Feb and 10 Mar this year [2025], according to official figures.
 
 
 
 The district recorded an average of 5 such cases daily. Two deaths had been reported during this period. They included a 51-year-old female and 28-year-old male inmates at a care home for the destitute and elderly at Veliyathunad in Karumaloor panchayat near Aluva, which had reported nearly 20 cases over the past one month.
 
 
 
 Between 1 Feb and 10 Mar 2025, the highest number (20) of hepatitis A cases in the district was reported on 7 Mar 2025. On 1 Mar 2025, as many as 19 cases were reported, while 15 cases were recorded on 1 Feb 2025, as per data available with the Department of Health.
 
 
 
 In Karumaloor, a cluster-like situation was found at the centre for the destitute and elderly.
 
 
 
 TK Ayyappan, member of Paruvakkadu ward in Veliyathunad, said over 150 persons were residing at the facility. Samples were collected from a well on the premises, and drinking water was distributed through the Kerala Water Authority network, he said.
 
 
 
 The ward member said that the care home residents were not using well water for drinking as it was mainly used for secondary purposes. The Health authorities had collected samples to ascertain the source of contamination, he said.
 
 
 
 Ramla Latheef, chairperson of the panchayat's standing committee on health, said super-chlorination of wells at the centre and nearby homes had been carried out to prevent an outbreak. She said a majority of those who were infected had other age-related ailments.
 
 
 
 Health officials in the civic body had visited the homes in the ward to sensitise the public to the need to use boiled drinking water and avoid having food or juices from eateries functioning in unhygienic surroundings.
 
 
 
 The health workers also urged residents to avoid eating stale food or food left open. They have also been advised to wash hands with soap before handling food, after eating, and after using the toilet.

 Hepatitis A warning issued by AHS after case confirmed in Edmonton Tim Horton's worker
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Alberta Health Services has issued an alert after a person who was working at an Edmonton Tim Horton's restaurant was confirmed to have hepatitis A. The individual prepared food at the Milbourne Market Mall location at 7535 38 Avenue while infectious. Anyone who consumed food or drink from the restaurant from 20 Feb 2025 to 5 Mar 2025 may have been exposed.
 
 
 
 AHS says anyone who ate at the restaurant from 1 to 5 Mar 2025 may be eligible for post-exposure immunization and is urged to call Health Link at 1-866-301-2668 for assessment. Vaccine clinics will be scheduled in Edmonton for eligible individuals.
 
 
 
 There is a limited window for an exposed person to be vaccinated. The last day for people to receive immunizations is as follows:
 
 1 Mar 2025 15 Mar 2025
 
 2 Mar 2025 16 Mar 2025
 
 4 Mar 2025 18 Mar 2025
 
 5 Mar 2025 19 Mar 2025
 
 
 
 Anyone who ate at the restaurant between 20-28 Feb 2025 is no longer eligible for post-exposure immunization. They should watch for symptoms for 50 days and contact their doctor if symptoms develop.
 
 
 
 Symptoms include tiredness, poor appetite, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever followed by dark-coloured urine, light-coloured stools, and yellowing of eyes and skin several days later. Some people, especially young children, may get hepatitis A without noticing any symptoms, but they are still infectious to others.
 
 
 
 Hepatitis A is an infection of the liver caused by a virus and is generally contracted through contact with an infected person, but it can also be contracted through ingesting contaminated food. If an infected individual does not wash their hands properly after using the bathroom, the virus can be transmitted through food and drink prepared by the infected individual.

 Measles Cases Increase in Mexico; Authorities Issue Epidemiological Notice
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 The Ministry of Health has issued an epidemiological notice due to the increase in measles infections in Mexico. The notification calls on all primary, secondary, and tertiary care medical units to maintain surveillance and prevention measures to contain the disease.
 
 
 
 ""To prevent the reintroduction of the measles virus [in the Mexican Republic], it is necessary to maintain adequate epidemiological surveillance focused on the detection, reporting, and timely diagnosis of probable cases of measles or rubella. Likewise, it is necessary to obtain quality epidemiological information to guide actions to strengthen health promotion, specific prevention, and disease control,"" health authorities indicated.
 
 
 
 As of Tuesday [12 Mar 2025], the National Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance (Conave) has recorded 416 probable cases. Of these, 22 have been confirmed: 18 in the state of Oaxaca and 4 in Coahuila. 68% of the patients are men and 32% are women, between the ages of 1 and 19. The federal agency specified that the majority of cases have been reported in the population between 5 and 9 years of age.
 
 
 
 ""Regarding vaccination history, it was found that 86% (19) of the confirmed cases have no vaccination history, while 9% (2) have received 1 dose, and 4% (1) have received 2 doses documented in the National Vaccination Card,"" the agency added.
 
 
 
 The decline in vaccination rates has led to a resurgence of measles in various regions of the world. In 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded 10.3 million cases globally, representing a 20% increase compared to the previous year [2022]. While most infections were concentrated in Africa, Southeast Asia, Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Western Pacific, the disease has begun to spread in the Americas, where worrying outbreaks have been reported in the United States, Canada, and Argentina.

 European Region reports highest number of measles cases in more than 25 years
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 [A total of] 127 350 measles cases were reported in the European Region in 2024, double the number of cases reported for 2023 and the highest number since 1997, according to an analysis by WHO and UNICEF.
 
 
 
 Children under 5 accounted for more than 40% of reported cases in the Region, comprising 53 countries in Europe and Central Asia. More than half of the reported cases required hospitalization. A total of 38 deaths have been reported, based on preliminary data received as of 6 March 2025.
 
 
 
 Measles cases in the Region have generally been declining since 1997, when some 216 000 were reported, reaching a low of 4440 cases in 2016. However, a resurgence was seen in 2018 and 2019 with 89 000 and 106 000 cases reported for the 2 years, respectively. Following a backsliding in immunization coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic, cases rose significantly again in 2023 and 2024. Vaccination rates in many countries are yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, increasing the risk of outbreaks.
 
 
 
 ""Measles is back, and it's a wake-up call. Without high vaccination rates, there is no health security. As we shape our new regional health strategy for Europe and Central Asia, we cannot afford to lose ground. Every country must step up efforts to reach under-vaccinated communities,"" warned Dr Hans P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe. ""The measles virus never rests --and neither can we.""
 
 
 
 The European Region accounted for one-third of all measles cases globally in 2024. In 2023 alone, 500 000 children across the Region missed the first dose of the measles vaccine (MCV1) that should be given through routine immunization services.
 
 
 
 ""Measles cases across Europe and Central Asia have soared over the past 2 years -- pointing to gaps in immunization coverage,"" said Regina De Dominicis, UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia. ""To protect children from this deadly and debilitating disease, we need urgent government action including sustained investment in health care workers.""
 
 
 
 Measles is one of the most contagious viruses affecting people. As well as hospitalization and death caused by complications including pneumonia, encephalitis, diarrhea, and dehydration, measles can cause long-term, debilitating health complications such as blindness. It can also damage the immune system by ""erasing"" its memory of how to fight infections, leaving measles survivors vulnerable to other diseases. Vaccination is the best line of defence against the virus.
 
 
 
 Less than 80% of eligible children in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Romania were vaccinated with MCV1 in 2023 -- far below the 95% coverage rate required to retain herd immunity. In both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, the coverage rate for MCV1 has remained below 70% and 50% respectively for the past 5 or more years.
 
 
 
 Romania reported the highest number of cases in the Region for 2024, with 30 692 cases, followed by Kazakhstan with 28 147 cases.
 
 
 
 Measles remains a significant global threat. Some 359 521 cases of measles have been reported for 2024 worldwide. Transmission of the virus across borders and continents occurs regularly, and outbreaks of this highly infectious disease will occur wherever the virus finds pockets of un- or under-vaccinated people, particularly children.
 
 
 
 UNICEF and WHO are working together with governments, and with support of partners including the European Union and the GAVI Alliance, to prevent and respond to measles outbreaks -- by engaging with communities, training health care workers, strengthening immunization programmes and disease surveillance systems and initiating measles immunization catch-up campaigns.
 
 
 
 UNICEF and WHO are calling for governments with active outbreaks to urgently intensify case finding, contact tracing and conduct emergency vaccination campaigns. It is imperative that countries analyse the root causes of outbreaks, address weaknesses in their health systems, and strategically utilize epidemiological data to identify and close coverage gaps. Reaching hesitant parents and marginalized communities and tackling inequitable access to vaccines must be central to all efforts.
 
 
 
 Countries that do not have current measles outbreaks should be prepared, including through identifying and addressing gaps in immunity, building and sustaining public trust in vaccines and maintaining strong health systems.

 Potential measles exposure alerts issued after confirmed cases in Calgary area and northern Alberta
 
 ------------------------------------------------
 
 Alberta Health Services issued advisories on Friday [14 Mar 2025] to warn the public about possible exposure to confirmed measles cases in the Calgary area as well as in Fort Vermilion.
 
 
 
 Around Calgary, the health agency said someone had been in public while infectious with measles, warning people who visited the Airdrie Superstore on 300 Veterans Boulevard NE on 8 Mar [2025] between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. that they may have been exposed. Anyone who was at the Sky Castle Family Entertainment Centre and cafeteria in the New Horizon Mall in Balzac on 9 Mar between noon and 3 p.m. may also have been exposed. Other locations and times for potential exposures include Airdrie Urgent Care on 11 Mar from 3:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. and One Health Associate Medical Clinic on 12 Mar between 9 a.m. and 10:30 a.m.
 
 
 
 Measles is one of the most infectious communicable diseases in the world and spreads easily through the air, leaving health officials concerned about its transmission.
 
 
 
 The news comes after health officials warned the public about a measles outbreak in the northern Alberta community of John D'Or Prairie, which is part of the Little Red River Cree Nation. The outbreak includes 6 confirmed cases. Little Red River Cree Nation Chief Conroy Sewepagaham said on Friday [14 Mar 2025] that all confirmed cases are fully recovered, but the risk of the virus remains. He added that mobile vaccination clinics are offering immunization shots around the community, and will continue to do so into next week.
 
 
 
 AHS issued another advisory on Friday notifying the public of several confirmed measles cases near the Fort Vermilion area in northern Alberta. The advisory states people may have been exposed to cases at the St. Theresa General Hospital -- including in its emergency department, acute care unit, and pediatric unit -- dating as far back as 15 Feb 2025 and as recently as 9 Mar 2025.
 
 
 
 The full list of dates and times where people may have been exposed to measles in Fort Vermilion can be found at <https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/Page18816.aspx>. AHS responded by setting up drop-in measles immunization clinics in Fort Vermilion and High Level on Saturday [15 Mar 2025].
 
 
 
 The health agency says anyone who was born in or after 1970 and has less than 2 documented doses of measles-containing vaccine is at risk, and they strongly encourage people to review their vaccination records and monitor for symptoms. To get the kind of coverage needed to limit the spread of measles, University of Calgary professor Craig Jenne says close to 95 per cent of people in communities should be vaccinated. But Alberta's childhood vaccination rates have dropped in recent years. Provincial data shows that in 2023, 69.3 percent of Alberta children were fully vaccinated with 2 doses of the measles vaccine by the age of 2. In several parts of the province, the immunization rate was well below 50 percent.
 
 
 
 Jenne, a professor in the department of microbiology, immunology, and infectious diseases, partly attributed the decline to hesitancy and vaccine fatigue, but also some vaccination programs being derailed when medical resources were deployed to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Parents found it a little harder to get their kids vaccinated on time, on schedule, and we're really still working through that backlog now,"" Jenne said.
 
 
 
 Between Ontario facing its most severe measles outbreak in more than a decade, and Alberta experiencing its deadliest flu season in more than a decade as well as a whooping cough outbreak last year [2024], Jenne says we're not seeing enough vaccine coverage to protect against preventable diseases. He said that health authorities need to be clear when emphasizing the effectiveness and safety of treatments like the measles vaccine, and he recommended people look to reliable sources of information to learn more about these shots, like pediatricians, family care providers, or walk-in clinics.
 
 
 
 The ease of travel, across Canada and internationally, can also create difficulty in monitoring and responding to measles outbreaks. University of Manitoba head of pediatric infectious diseases Jared Bullard noted cases have thus far been reported around Canada and south of the border, with an outbreak in Texas. ""Measles is really one plane ride away, and all it takes is for us to go to someplace elsewhere in the world, and we can bring measles back pretty easily,"" Bullard said. He added that because many people haven't seen measles outbreaks in years, the lack of a living memory can make it difficult to communicate just how dangerous and contagious the disease is.
 
 
 
 ""People haven't seen it, so they don't know. And that even holds true for a number of health-care providers. They haven't necessarily seen measles, so they don't think about it,"" Bullard said. ""We're trying to say if you see a fever, a cough, red eyes, and a rash that starts on your head and goes all the way down your body ... you really have to think about measles.""
 
 
 
 While Jenne says now isn't a time to panic, he notes it is a good reminder to be vigilant in keeping up with vaccinations, even if people are feeling frustrated or tired after the COVID-19 pandemic and more recent concerns with bird flu. ""It's really hard to blame people for frustration or fatigue,"" Jenne said. ""Sadly, the viruses don't care if we're tired or angry or frustrated. They simply take advantage when we let our guard down, and it is a reminder we do have to be vigilant.""
 
 
 
 Anyone who believes they may have been exposed to measles and develops symptoms should stay home, Jenne advised. He added that people should call Health Link first if they're concerned, rather than potentially visiting a doctor's office or hospital while infectious.

 Nearly 40 000 suspected measles cases, 5 deaths, Ministry of Health warns of epidemic
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 In the first 3 months of this year [2025], Vietnam recorded about 40 000 suspected measles cases, including 5 deaths, equivalent to the total number of cases last year [2024], the Ministry of Health recommends disease prevention.
 
 
 
 Mr. Hoang Minh Duc, Director of the Department of Disease Prevention, announced the above information at the National Online Conference on Measles Prevention, held on the afternoon of 15 Mar 2025. According to statistics, among the suspected cases of measles (fever and rash, not tested positive), more than 3000 cases have been confirmed positive. Of which, 5 deaths were recorded in Ho Chi Minh City, Dong Nai, Binh Duong, Quang Nam and Binh Phuoc.
 
 
 
 Measles outbreaks are currently occurring in most provinces and cities, especially concentrated in the South with 57% of total cases, the Central region with 19%, the North with 15%, and the Central Highlands with 9%. Some localities have recorded a sharp increase in the number of cases, including Cao Bang, Nghe An, Khanh Hoa, Dak Lak, Gia Lai, Dong Thap, An Giang and Lam Dong.
 
 
 
 Statistical analysis shows that the group of children from 9 months to under 15 years old has the highest rate of infection with 73%. Children under 6 months old and from 6 months to under 9 months old, the group not yet old enough to be vaccinated, account for 5% and 10% respectively.
 
  
 
 The records also showed that the rate of boys with measles exceeded that of girls, 56% and 44% respectively. Notably, 91% of all cases had not been vaccinated, 5% had unknown vaccination history, and only 4% had been vaccinated.
 
 
 
 Meanwhile, at the National Children's Hospital, more than 1000 measles cases have been recorded since the beginning of the year [2025], most of them children who have not been vaccinated.
 
 
 
 Minister of Health Dao Hong Lan said that according to the warning of the World Health Organization (WHO), from 2024, the number of measles cases will increase rapidly globally, with the risk of outbreaks in many countries due to low vaccination rates, reaching only 80% or lower.
 
 
 
 In Vietnam, the measles vaccination rate is not up to standard, and the situation is even more serious as the country is entering a 5-year outbreak cycle . In addition, climate change also makes the epidemic more complicated and unpredictable.
 
 
 
 Transmitted through the respiratory tract, measles is highly contagious, with 90% of non-immune people contracting the disease if they come into close contact with an infected person. On average, each patient can infect 12-18 others. Herd immunity is only effective in preventing the disease when the vaccination rate reaches at least 95%.
 
 
 
 The health sector predicts that the number of measles cases will continue to increase in the coming time, especially in high-risk areas such as mountainous areas or localities with low vaccination rates, where access to health services is limited.
 
 
 
 In this context, the Ministry of Health has launched a plan to implement a nationwide measles vaccination campaign by 2025. This plan expands the vaccination group to include children aged 6-9 months in 24 provinces and cities, while continuing to add children aged 1-10 years and high-risk groups in 17 other provinces and cities.
 
 
 
 However, Mr. Duc admitted that the health sector is currently facing many difficulties in epidemic prevention, especially in terms of vaccine supply. Ensuring adequate vaccines currently depends on international support, while localities have not yet proactively purchased vaccines and arranged funding for implementation. Mr. Duc called on provinces and cities to urgently implement this measure to minimize the risk of an outbreak.
 
 
 
 Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that is primarily transmitted through the respiratory tract by close contact or by secretions from the nose and throat of an infected person. Typical symptoms include fever, sore throat, conjunctivitis and rash, but the disease can also cause many dangerous complications such as otitis media, pneumonia, diarrhea and encephalitis, even leading to death. Young children and malnourished children are the most severely affected.

 [Editado por Jaime Torres]
 
 
 
  
 
 Un grupo de reci√©n nacidos en el University Medical Center Children‚Äôs Hospital de Lubbock, Texas, fue expuesto al sarampi√≥n despu√©s de que una madre ingresara al hospital para dar a luz sin que los m√©dicos supieran que estaba infectada con el virus. La situaci√≥n, ocurrida en plena expansi√≥n del brote en la regi√≥n, ha obligado a las autoridades sanitarias a tomar medidas de emergencia para proteger a los beb√©s y evitar m√°s contagios.
 
 
 
  
 
 El personal m√©dico del hospital comenz√≥ a administrar a los reci√©n nacidos inyecciones de inmunoglobulina, una terapia de anticuerpos dise√±ada para ayudar a fortalecer el sistema inmunol√≥gico y reducir el riesgo de infecci√≥n en beb√©s que han estado expuestos al virus. De acuerdo con un estudio de 2021, este tratamiento ha demostrado ser altamente efectivo en la prevenci√≥n del sarampi√≥n en casos de exposici√≥n. ‚ÄúEstos beb√©s no pidieron esta exposici√≥n, pero esta es la √∫nica manera de protegerlos‚Äù, declar√≥ Chad Curry, jefe de capacitaci√≥n del servicio de emergencias m√©dicas del hospital.
 
 
 
 Si bien los representantes del hospital no han dado una cifra exacta de la cantidad de reci√©n nacidos expuestos, se ha confirmado que la paciente con sarampi√≥n tuvo contacto con otras madres, beb√©s y familias dentro del hospital. El virus, considerado uno de los m√°s contagiosos del mundo, puede permanecer activo en el aire o en superficies durante hasta dos horas, lo que aumenta la posibilidad de nuevos contagios.
 
 
 
 El brote de sarampi√≥n que afecta a Texas, Nuevo M√©xico y ahora Oklahoma ha crecido r√°pidamente en las √∫ltimas semanas. Seg√∫n el Departamento de Servicios de Salud de Texas, hasta el viernes se hab√≠an registrado 259 casos en el estado, de los cuales 201 corresponden a ni√±os y adolescentes. En Nuevo M√©xico, el n√∫mero de contagios ha ascendido a 35, mientras que Oklahoma confirm√≥ sus primeros dos casos esta semana.
 
 
 
 La enfermedad ha cobrado la vida de al menos una ni√±a de seis a√±os en el condado de Gaines, Texas, y las autoridades investigan otro posible fallecimiento en Nuevo M√©xico, en un adulto que no estaba vacunado contra el sarampi√≥n. De acuerdo con los Centros para el Control y la Prevenci√≥n de Enfermedades (CDC), la gran mayor√≠a de los casos registrados en este brote corresponden a personas que no han recibido la vacuna.
 
 
 
 El epicentro del brote sigue siendo el oeste de Texas, una zona donde los niveles de vacunaci√≥n han sido hist√≥ricamente bajos en comparaci√≥n con otras partes del pa√≠s. Las autoridades sanitarias han se√±alado que la propagaci√≥n del virus se ha visto favorecida por la falta de inmunizaci√≥n en algunos sectores de la poblaci√≥n.
 
 
 
 Ante el aumento de casos, los hospitales y centros de salud en Texas han implementado protocolos de emergencia para evitar la propagaci√≥n del virus en espacios cerrados. En el University Medical Center Children‚Äôs Hospital, donde ocurri√≥ la exposici√≥n a los reci√©n nacidos, se ha establecido el uso obligatorio de mascarillas en diversas √°reas, especialmente en aquellas donde se encuentran pacientes vulnerables.
 
 
 
 Adem√°s de la administraci√≥n de inmunoglobulina a los beb√©s expuestos, los m√©dicos han reforzado la vigilancia de s√≠ntomas en pacientes recientes y han iniciado un rastreo de contactos para identificar a todas las personas que pudieron haber estado en riesgo dentro del hospital. La directora del departamento de salud de Lubbock, Katherine Wells, reconoci√≥ que este incidente representa un retroceso en los esfuerzos por controlar el brote. ‚ÄúSe siente como si volvi√©ramos al punto de partida‚Äù, dijo en una entrevista el viernes.
 
 
 
 Los expertos han insistido en que, si bien la inmunoglobulina puede ofrecer protecci√≥n temporal, no sustituye la vacunaci√≥n. El jefe de emergencias m√©dicas, Chad Curry, advirti√≥ que los beb√©s expuestos deber√°n recibir la vacuna contra el sarampi√≥n cuando alcancen la edad recomendada. ‚ÄúEste tratamiento solo protege por un corto per√≠odo de tiempo. La √∫nica protecci√≥n total es la vacunaci√≥n‚Äù, enfatiz√≥.
 
 
 
 . La vacuna contra el sarampi√≥n, paperas y rub√©ola (MMR, por sus siglas en ingl√©s) es segura y altamente efectiva, con una tasa de protecci√≥n superior al 97% despu√©s de la segunda dosis. En los √∫ltimos a√±os, sin embargo, ha habido un aumento en la cantidad de ni√±os no vacunados, lo que ha llevado a un resurgimiento del sarampi√≥n en varias partes de Estados Unidos. De acuerdo con los CDC, la desinformaci√≥n sobre la seguridad de las vacunas y la disminuci√≥n en las tasas de inmunizaci√≥n han contribuido al rebrote de enfermedades prevenibles.
 
 
 
 Las autoridades de salud han reiterado su llamado a la poblaci√≥n para que tome medidas de precauci√≥n y se asegure de que sus hijos est√©n al d√≠a con el esquema de vacunaci√≥n. Adem√°s, han recomendado a las personas que puedan haber estado expuestas a casos de sarampi√≥n que est√©n atentas a los s√≠ntomas y busquen atenci√≥n m√©dica si presentan fiebre o erupci√≥n cut√°nea.
 
 
 
 Los hospitales y cl√≠nicas en Texas y Nuevo M√©xico contin√∫an trabajando para contener el brote y evitar nuevas exposiciones. Sin embargo, la r√°pida propagaci√≥n del virus ha puesto a prueba los sistemas de salud locales y ha resaltado la necesidad de mantener altas tasas de vacunaci√≥n para evitar futuros brotes. ‚ÄúNo podemos permitirnos bajar la guardia‚Äù, advirti√≥ Wells.
 
 
 
 El caso de los reci√©n nacidos expuestos en Lubbock es un recordatorio de los riesgos que el sarampi√≥n representa para los m√°s vulnerables. Mientras los m√©dicos y enfermeros siguen administrando inmunoglobulina a los beb√©s afectados, la comunidad m√©dica insiste en que la √∫nica manera de erradicar el virus es con la vacunaci√≥n generalizada.

 Depois de dois anos sem casos, Portugal registou 35 casos de sarampo em 2024
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 No ano passado [2024], foram identificados 35 casos de sarampo em Portugal [veja o post PRO/PORT> Sarampo - Portugal (09), novos casos confirmados, surto Archive Number: 20240801.8717887, <https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8717887> - Mod. RNA] depois de n√£o haver nenhum caso da doen√ßa em 2022 e em 2023. √Ä semelhan√ßa do que aconteceu com a maior parte dos infectados em 2024, tamb√©m as 3 pessoas identificadas este ano com a doen√ßa em Portugal n√£o estavam vacinadas.
 
 
 
 Dos 35 casos registados em 2024 - de um total de 235 casos suspeitos notificados -, 20 foram detectados na regi√£o de Lisboa e Vale do Tejo, dez na regi√£o Norte, quatro na zona Centro e um no arquip√©lago da Madeira. Apenas cinco pessoas necessitaram de internamento e nenhuma foi v√≠tima da doen√ßa. A maior parte das pessoas com sarampo (21) n√£o estava vacinada, sendo que as restantes estavam vacinadas com duas doses (12) ou com uma dose (duas pessoas).
 
 
 
 Este ano [2025], at√© ao momento, j√° foram contabilizados tr√™s casos de sarampo, 2 na regi√£o de Lisboa e Vale do Tejo e 1 na regi√£o Centro. Segundo a informa√ß√£o avan√ßada pela Dire√ß√£o-Geral da Sa√∫de (DGS), a doen√ßa foi identificada em dois adultos e numa crian√ßa - todos n√£o vacinados -, tratando-se de ""casos importados"", ""com origem da infec√ß√£o identificada noutro pa√≠s"". Os pacientes apresentam uma evolu√ß√£o cl√≠nica ""favor√°vel"" e, at√© ao momento, ""n√£o foram identificados casos secund√°rios"".
 
 
 
 Ainda que Portugal apresente uma cobertura vacinal para o sarampo elevada, adianta a DGS, a ""introdu√ß√£o de novos casos pode acontecer e promover a dissemina√ß√£o em comunidades cuja cobertura vacinal n√£o seja t√£o elevada"". No entanto, ""n√£o s√£o esperados surtos de grande dimens√£o"", l√™-se no comunicado.
 
 
 
 Refira-se que, na √∫ltima sexta-feira [14/mar√ßo/2025], o Centro Europeu de Preven√ß√£o e Controlo de Doen√ßas (ECDC) alertou para o fato de que a diminui√ß√£o da vacina√ß√£o levou a um aumento de quase dez vezes no n√∫mero de casos de sarampo na Europa no √∫ltimo ano. Em comunicado, a ag√™ncia da Uni√£o Europeia revelou que 32.265 pessoas foram diagnosticadas com a doen√ßa na Uni√£o Europeia e no Espa√ßo Econ√≥mico Europeu (UE/EEE), verificando-se um aumento significativo em compara√ß√£o com os 3973 casos registados em 2023. O aumento das infec√ß√µes reflete uma taxa de ades√£o √† vacina√ß√£o ""conscientemente abaixo do ideal"", explicou o centro europeu, tal como avan√ßou a ag√™ncia Lusa.

 Measles case and exposure confirmed in Swift Current
 
 ------------------------------------------
 
 The Saskatchewan Health Authority has confirmed a case of measles in Swift Current that's created an exposure risk to the public. The individual with the virus was at the Cypress Regional Hospital between 7 and 10 Mar [2025] and the E.I. Wood Building (the entrance, elevator, and fourth floor) on 6 Mar [2025] between 3:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.
 
 
 
 Dr. David Torr, medical health officer with the Saskatchewan Health Authority and area department lead for the Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine for the Integrated Rural Area, told Swift Current Online measles is airborne and also highly contagious.
 
 
 
 ""It's not about coughing or squeezing -- it's just about being in the vicinity of somebody who had the measles,"" he said. ""We're advising the public, especially those who were in the vicinity, but also the general public at large, to make sure they're up to date with their measles vaccines. It's really important because the measles vaccines are very effective, and the measles infection is very strong.""
 
 
 
 He cited the ideal vaccination rate for measles in the province is 95 percent, but noted Swift Current is below that threshold, sitting in the 80s.
 
 
 
 The early signs of the virus include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, fatigue, muscle aches, and irritability, but will progress into a rash and mouth sores.
 
 
 
 ""Until the rash comes out, it's very easy to mimic other infections like influenza or other viral infections,"" he said. ""The rash is very characteristic.
 
 
 
 ""Measles can give you very high temperatures and fevers. For young children, that easily predisposes them to convulsions. The aftereffects or complications of measles include infections and inflammation of the brain, ears, a lot of parts of the body. Even deafness can follow, or an effect on the eyes... There are many complications that can come in, and because it weakens the body so much, you can get secondary infections like pneumonia.""
 
 
 
 The SHA urges anyone with the symptoms listed above or that were at the Cypress Regional Hospital or E.I. Wood Building to call the emergency department, physician, walk-in clinic, or nurse practitioner before showing up due to the highly contagious nature of the virus.

 Measles warning in Victoria and NSW as new cases linked to travel from Bali and other Asian destinations
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Health authorities in Victoria and New South Wales have issued fresh measles alerts following multiple confirmed cases in both states. The outbreaks are linked to international travel, with several exposure sites identified, including hospitals, nightclubs, shopping centres, and flights.
 
 
 
 Five new measles cases have been detected in Victoria, bringing the state's total to 13 so far in 2025. Three cases are linked to recent travel from Bali, while 2 others are connected to a local outbreak. One case of the highly infectious disease was transmitted within a primary healthcare waiting room, according to Victoria's health department.
 
 
 
 Recent exposure sites in Melbourne include:
 
 
 
 - Nightclubs on Chapel Street: Revolver Upstairs, ONESIXONE, and Somewhere Bar over the Labor Day long weekend
 
 - Shopping Centres and Hotels: 7 shops at Highpoint Shopping Centre, the Taylor's Lakes Hotel, and fast-food outlets in Mornington on 7 March
 
 - Hospitals: Frankston Hospital's emergency department (11-13 March) and Rosebud Hospital's emergency department (11 March).
 
 
 
 People who visited these locations are urged to monitor for symptoms, which can appear up to 18 days after exposure. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, and rash, with severe cases potentially leading to pneumonia or brain inflammation.
 
 
 
 Victoria's health department noted that vaccination rates have been below the 95 percent national target since the COVID-19 pandemic, with most recent cases occurring in unvaccinated individuals.
 
 
 
 The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is free for those born after 1966 and is particularly recommended for travellers to Southeast Asia.
 
 
 
 NSW Health has confirmed a measles case in a person who recently returned from Southeast Asia, where outbreaks are ongoing in Thailand, Viet Nam, and Indonesia. The individual was infectious while on an international flight and visited several locations in Sydney.
 
 
 
 Potential exposure sites include:
 
 
 
 - Monday, 10 March: Vietnam Airlines flight VN773 from Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney, and Sydney International Airport arrivals terminal and baggage claim (10 a.m. - 12 p.m.)
 
 - Thursday, 13 March: The Children's Hospital at Westmead Emergency Department waiting room (10:30 a.m. - 5 p.m.)
 
 
 
 South Western Sydney Local Health District's Dr Mitchell Smith has urged anyone who was in these locations to monitor for symptoms until the end of March [2025]. Smith emphasized that measles is an airborne disease spread through coughing and sneezing, and those who develop symptoms should call ahead before visiting their GP or hospital to avoid exposing others.

 Mongolia's total number of confirmed measles cases exceeds 50
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
 Mongolia has recorded 24 new cases of measles infection over the past 24 hours, bringing the national caseload to 51, according to the country's National Centre for Communicable Diseases (NCCD) on Monday [17 Mar 2025].
 
 
 
 According to Mongolian doctors, measles is caused by a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus with one serotype. In view of this, the NCCD urged parents to pay attention to the symptoms of measles at an early stage among their children and seek emergency medical care immediately. Measles is a highly contagious viral disease transmitted by respiratory droplets and direct contact. Common complications include fever, dry cough, runny nose, sore throat, and inflamed eyes. The disease can be prevented by immunization. There is no specific treatment for measles, and most people recover within 2 to 3 weeks, Xinhua news agency reported. It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications, and even death.
 
 
 
 Measles can affect anyone but is most common in children. Measles infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus. Before the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every 2 to 3 years and caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year. An estimated 107 500 people died from measles in 2023 -- mostly children under the age of 5 years, despite the availability of a safe and cost-effective vaccine.
 
 
 
 Measles is still common, particularly in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. The overwhelming majority of measles deaths occur in countries with low per capita incomes or weak health infrastructures that struggle to reach all children with immunisation. All children or adults with measles should receive 2 doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart. This restores low vitamin A levels that occur even in well-nourished children. It can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements may also reduce the number of measles deaths.

 Nigeria has recorded 23 new suspected cases of diphtheria in the 10th epidemiological week of 2025, with Lagos State being the most affected state in the reporting week.
 
 
 
 According to the latest situation report by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC), Lagos State accounted for 20 cases, followed by Katsina State with 3 cases.
 
 
 
 The increase in Lagos' cases follows the recent outbreak at Kings College Lagos, where 14 students were infected, and one fatality was recorded.
 
 
 
 Following the outbreak, the Lagos State Government initiated an emergency vaccination campaign for students and staff. Most of the infected students are receiving treatment at Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) and are showing signs of recovery.
 
 
 
 The school principal, Mogaji Zakaria, outlined measures taken to contain the outbreak, including improved hygiene protocols and mask mandates. However, some parents have criticised the school's sanitary conditions, calling for better infrastructure.
 
 
 
 The Lagos State's Commissioner for Health, Akin Abayomi, assured the public that the situation is under control, with 12 students responding well to treatment. The affected students are expected to be discharged soon.
 
 
 
 National Situation Report
 
 ----------------------------
 
 According to NCDC, between May 2022 and March 2025, Nigeria recorded 1319 deaths from diphtheria.
 
 
 
 Cumulatively, from Epi-Week 19, 2022, to Epi-Week 10, 2025, a total of 42 642 suspected cases were reported across 37 states and 350 local government areas (LGAs).
 
 
 
 Kano (24 239), Yobe (5330), Katsina (4237), Bauchi (3066), Borno (3058), Kaduna (777), and Jigawa (364) accounted for 96.3 per cent of the suspected cases reported.
 
 
 
 Of the suspected cases, 25 812 (60.5 per cent) were confirmed, including 396 laboratory-confirmed cases, 216 epidemiologically linked cases, and 25 200 clinically compatible cases. The confirmed cases were spread across 184 LGAs in 26 states.
 
 
 
 Kano recorded the highest number of confirmed cases (18 108), followed by Bauchi (2334), Yobe (2408), Katsina (1501), Borno (1161), Jigawa (53), Plateau (119), and Kaduna (44). These states accounted for 99.7 per cent of confirmed cases.
 
 
 
 Children aged one to 14 years made up 62.9 per cent (16 234) of confirmed cases, but only 19.3 per cent (4981) of them were fully vaccinated with a diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine.
 
 
 
 The case fatality rate (CFR) among confirmed cases stands at 5.1 per cent, with a total of 1319 deaths recorded.
 
 
 
 Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection caused by _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, primarily affecting the mucous membranes of the nose, throat, and occasionally the skin.
 
 
 
 The disease spreads through respiratory droplets, direct contact with an infected individual, or contaminated objects. Symptoms include sore throat, difficulty swallowing, fever, and swollen neck glands. A thick gray membrane may form over the throat and tonsils, obstructing the airway.
 
 
 
 If untreated, diphtheria can lead to severe complications such as myocarditis, nerve damage, kidney failure, or breathing problems. Diagnosis involves a clinical examination and swab culture, especially when the characteristic gray membrane is present.

 Newborn babies exposed to measles in Texas hospital
 
 ------------------------------------------------
 
 On Wednesday [12 Mar 2024], a woman gave birth in a Lubbock, Texas, hospital in the middle of a deadly and fast-growing measles outbreak. Doctors didn't realize until the young mother had been admitted and in labor that she was infected with the measles. By that time, other new moms, newborn babies, and their families at University Medical Center Children's Hospital in Lubbock had unknowingly been exposed to the virus, considered one of the most contagious in the world.
 
 
 
 Hospital staff are scrambling with damage control efforts -- implementing emergency masking policies and giving babies as young as 2 days old injections of immunoglobulin, an antibody that helps their fragile immune system fight off infections. A 2021 study found that the therapy is highly effective in protecting exposed newborns from getting sick.
 
 
 
 ""These babies didn't ask for this exposure,"" said Chad Curry, training chief for the University Medical Center EMS. ""But at the end of the day, this is the only way we can protect them.""
 
 
 
 Neither Curry nor UMC representatives could give an exact number of exposed newborns. It's unclear when the woman tested positive for measles. Public health officials are casting a wide net in an effort to contact everyone who may have been exposed to this particular patient. Viral particles can live in the air or on surfaces for up to 2 hours.
 
 
 
 It's a setback for public health officials on the front lines trying to stop the escalating outbreak. At the end of last week, Katherine Wells, director of public health for Lubbock's health department, said she felt like the outbreak was beginning to be controlled. At the time, cases seemed to have peaked. Doctors offices had become savvy at making sure patients likely to have a measles exposure steered clear of other patients. This new development, she said in an interview Friday [14 Mar 2025], ""feels like we're back to square one.""
 
 
 
 The outbreak expanded this week from Texas and New Mexico into Oklahoma, where 2 cases were confirmed. New Mexico has reported 35 cases. West Texas remains the epicenter of the outbreak that began last month [February 2025]. On Friday [14 Mar 2025], the Texas Department of State Health Services reported 259 measles cases. Most (201) have been in kids and teenagers. One child, a 6-year-old girl in Gaines County, Texas, died. Another death in an adult in New Mexico is under investigation. Neither had been vaccinated against measles.
 
 
 
 Altogether, the current number of cases has exceeded the total reported in 2024.
 
 
 
 Curry, who's administered several immunoglobulin shots to newborns in recent days, stressed that those babies will need to be vaccinated when they're old enough.
 
 
 
 ""This is only good for a small, short period of time,"" he said. ""They still need to be vaccinated. That is the only total protection.""

 A third of infected with measles in Kyrgyzstan - children under 12 months old
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 
 At least 4055 cases of measles have been registered in Kyrgyzstan since the beginning of 2025, including 8 deaths, Deputy Minister of Health Bubuzhan Arykbaeva said at a briefing.
 
 
 
 According to her, the epidemiological situation concerning measles in the republic remains unstable and tense. Among those infected, 95 percent are unvaccinated. The majority are children under 12 months old (32 percent) and children whose parents refused vaccinations (44 percent).
 
 
 
 ""Vaccination is a social norm for most families, but some of the population refuses it. Three stages of additional catch-up vaccination have been carried out in the country since 2024, covering 918 000 children. According to the results of 2024, about 14 400 cases of measles were registered in the Kyrgyz Republic. The main reason for the increase in the incidence rate is the low vaccination coverage, which is only 63 percent in Bishkek,"" Bubuzhan Arykbaeva said.
 
 
 
 She emphasized that vaccination safety issues may raise doubts, but the vaccine has undergone all the necessary scientific research and has proven its effectiveness.
 
 
 
 ""Vaccination is not just a medical procedure, but your concern for the health of the child. Vaccination protects children from serious diseases that have severe consequences,"" the deputy minister addressed the parents.

 Measles outbreak: new cases detected in Florencio Varela
 
 --------------------------------------------------
 
 In the midst of an epidemiological alert, health authorities confirmed 2 new cases of measles in Florencio Varela, bringing the total number of infections in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA) and the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area to 10. The newly infected are a 2-year-old boy and a 27-year-old adult, both close contacts of previous cases in the area. The child, identified as case 9, belongs to the same family as cases 7 and 8. He developed a rash (a skin rash characteristic of measles) on 8 March and has received one dose of the MMR vaccine, administered on his first birthday. Case 10, meanwhile, is a 27-year-old man with no verifiable vaccination history who lives near the other affected individuals in the district.
 
 
 
 These new infections reinforce the authorities' concern, as the outbreak continues to spread in the province of Buenos Aires. In total, 6 of the cases are in Commune 14 of Buenos Aires City and 4 in Florencio Varela, all linked to the same chain of transmission.
 
 
 
 Given this situation, the Ministry of Health recommends completing mandatory vaccination regimens and administering extra doses to children who have been in contact with confirmed cases. In particular, a ""zero dose"" is recommended for infants between 6 and 12 months old, while children between 13 months and 4 years old should receive an additional booster dose.

 Measles outbreak hits Spain with cases surging
 
 ----------------------------------------------
 
 For many years now measles has taken something of a backseat to other common illnesses, thanks in large part to the high number of parents who choose to vaccinate their children. But the disease is making an unwelcome comeback in 2025, both in Spain and in the rest of Europe.
 
 
 
 Here in Spain, measles cases have skyrocketed, with 142 cases reported in the first 2 months of the year [2025] compared to 229 in all of 2024, according to data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network of the National Epidemiology Centre of the Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII).
 
  
 
 By autonomous community, the data, which represent the period from 1 Jan 2025 to 9 Mar 2025, show that the Basque Country and Andaluc√≠a have reported the most cases, 91 and 15, respectively. Additionally, 3 cases have been reported in the Autonomous City of Melilla, 2 cases in Galicia, 2 in the Valencian Community and 1 in Madrid.
 
  
 
 In recent decades, vaccines have been one of the most effective tools for eradicating serious diseases, such as measles, which previously claimed the lives of thousands of children each year. However, in many countries, a growing number of parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children, contributing to the resurgence of previously controlled diseases like measles. Misinformation and distrust in vaccines have become one of the greatest challenges to global public health.
 
  
 
 Last Friday [14 Mar 2025], the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported the ""highest"" number of measles cases in Europe in 25 years, attributing it to the decline in vaccination, with nearly 90% of people diagnosed with measles in 2024 unvaccinated.
 
  
 
 The Spanish Association of Pediatrics recommends that children receive the tetraviral vaccine, which combines vaccinations for chickenpox, measles, mumps and rubella, at the age of 2. This vaccine reduces the risks associated with these diseases and provides fewer jabs and more protection.

 Measles Outbreak - 18 Mar 2025
 
 ------------------------------
 
 The Texas Department of State Health Services is reporting an outbreak of measles in the South Plains and Panhandle regions of Texas. At this time, 279 cases have been identified since late January [2025]. Thirty-six of the patients have been hospitalized. There has been one fatality in a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area. The child was not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.
 
 
 
 Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.
 
 
 
 Texas Outbreak Case Count by County

 Age Ranges of Outbreak Measles Cases
 
 ------------------------------------
 
 0 - 4 years = 88
 
 5 - 17 years = 120
 
 18+ years = 52
 
 Pending = 19
 
 
 
 Vaccination Status of Confirmed Cases in the Outbreak
 
 -----------------------------------------------------
 
 Unvaccinated/Unknown = 277
 
 Vaccinated: 1 dose = 0
 
 Vaccinated: 2+ doses = 2
 
 
 
 Note: The unvaccinated/unknown category includes people with no documented doses of measles vaccine more than 14 days before symptom onset.
 
 
 
 After additional investigation into the details of individual measles cases, DSHS has determined that 3 cases previously classified as vaccinated were not vaccinated cases. Two of those cases got their vaccine doses 1 to 2 days before their symptoms started, after they had been exposed to the virus. It takes the body about 14 days after vaccination to develop immunity to measles, so people aren't considered vaccinated until that 14-day period has passed.
 
 
 
 DSHS has determined that the 3rd case was a Lubbock County resident who had a vaccine reaction rather than a measles infection based on the results of MeVA testing, which detected the vaccine strain. This case has been removed from the case count entirely. The measles vaccine can occasionally cause a reaction with a rash and fever that mimic measles, but it is not a measles infection and cannot spread to other people.
 
 
 
 Measles Prevention
 
 ------------------
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with 2 doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.

 2025 Measles Outbreak Guidance
 
 ------------------------------
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.
 
 
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 Reports
 
 -------
 
 The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles originating in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is so contagious, additional cases are likely to occur in Lea County and the surrounding communities. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays by noon Mountain Standard Time if there are new cases to report.
 
 
 
 Total Cases = 38
 
 Vaccinated with at least one dose = 4
 
 Not Vaccinated = 29
 
 Unknown = 5
 
 
 
 New Mexico Case Count by County (as of 14 Mar 2025):
 
 
 
 County / Cases / Hospitalizations / Deaths
 
 ------------------------------------------
 
 Lea County / 36 / 2 / 1
 
 Eddy / 2 / 0 / 0
 
 
 
 Age Ranges of Measles Cases
 
 ---------------------------
 
 0-4 Years = 7
 
 5-17 Years = 10 
 
 18+ Years = 20 
 
 Pending = 1
 
 Total = 38
 
 
 
 Measles is primarily a disease of people who are not immunized and most residents in the outbreak area are protected from measles disease even if they are exposed to the virus. We expect to continue to identify new measles infections associated with this regional outbreak in New Mexico and Texas. This is not the explosive situation that we see with a pandemic where the population is unprotected. The measles cases that we have confirmed include persons with positive laboratory tests and persons who developed measles symptoms at the appropriate time following contact with a confirmed case. These cases were identified in the course of careful (epidemiologic) investigations. The newly added cases include people who were ill previously and were not identified until after their illness. The timing of rash onset for the current 38 cases shows them to be spread out over time and are not increasing dramatically:
 
 
 
 Week 1 (9 to 15 Feb 2025): 14
 
 Week 2 (16 to 22 Feb 2025): 6
 
 Week 3 (23 Feb to 1 Mar 2025): 8
 
 Week 4 (2 to 8 Mar 2025): 6
 
 Week 5 (9 to 15 Mar 2025): 4

 En plena alerta epidemiol√≥gica, las autoridades sanitarias confirmaron dos nuevos casos de sarampi√≥n en Florencio Varela, lo que eleva a diez el total de contagios en la Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires (CABA) y el conurbano bonaerense.
 
 
 
 Los nuevos infectados son un ni√±o de 2 a√±os y un adulto de 27, ambos contactos estrechos de casos previos en la zona. El menor, identificado como el caso 9, pertenece a la misma familia que los casos 7 y 8. Present√≥ exantema (erupci√≥n cut√°nea caracter√≠stica del sarampi√≥n) el 8 de marzo y cuenta con una dosis de la vacuna Triple Viral, aplicada al cumplir un a√±o.
 
 
 
 El caso 10, en tanto, es un hombre de 27 a√±os sin antecedentes de vacunaci√≥n comprobables, que vive cerca de los otros afectados en el distrito.
 
 
 
 Estos nuevos contagios refuerzan la preocupaci√≥n de las autoridades, ya que el brote sigue avanzando en la provincia de Buenos Aires. En total, seis de los casos corresponden a la Comuna 14 de CABA y cuatro a Florencio Varela, todos vinculados a la misma cadena de transmisi√≥n.
 
 
 
 Ante esta situaci√≥n, el Ministerio de Salud recomienda completar los esquemas obligatorios y aplicar dosis extra a los ni√±os que hayan estado en contacto con casos confirmados.

 After 2 years without cases, Portugal recorded 35 cases of measles in 2024
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Last year [2024], 35 cases of measles were identified in Portugal [see the post PRO/PORT> Measles - Portugal (09), new confirmed cases, outbreak Archive Number: 20240801.8717887- Mod.RNA] after there were no cases of the disease in 2022 and 2023. As with most of those infected in 2024, the 3 people identified with the disease in Portugal in 2025 were also not vaccinated.
 
 
 
 Of the 35 cases recorded in 2024 -- out of a total of 235 suspected cases reported -- 20 were detected in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley region, 10 in the North region, 4 in the Central region, and one in the Madeira archipelago. Only 5 people required hospitalization, and none died from the disease. Most people with measles (21) were not vaccinated, while the remainder were vaccinated with 2 doses (12) or with one dose (2 people).
 
 
 
 This year [2025], so far, 3 cases of measles have been recorded, 2 in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley region and one in the Central region. According to information provided by the Directorate-General for Health (DGS), the disease was identified in 2 adults and 1 child -- all unvaccinated -- and these are ""imported cases,"" ""with the origin of the infection identified in another country."" The patients are showing a ""favorable"" clinical evolution and, to date, ""no secondary cases have been identified.""
 
 
 
 Although Portugal has a high vaccination coverage for measles, the DGS states, the ""introduction of new cases may occur and promote the spread in communities where vaccination coverage is not as high."" However, ""large-scale outbreaks are not expected,"" the statement reads.
 
 
 
 It should be noted that last Friday [14 Mar 2025], the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) warned that the decrease in vaccination has led to an almost tenfold increase in the number of measles cases in Europe in the last year. In a statement, the European Union agency revealed that 32 265 people were diagnosed with the disease in the European Union and the European Economic Area (EU/EEA), a significant increase compared to the 3973 cases registered in 2023. The increase in infections reflects a vaccination adherence rate that is ""consciously below ideal,"" explained the European centre, as reported by the Lusa news agency.

Chickenpox Outbreak at La 40 Prison in Pereira
----------------------------------------------
Health authorities confirmed an outbreak of chickenpox at La 40 Prison in Pereira, forcing the isolation of 230 inmates in Courtyard 5 to prevent the spread of the virus. So far, 3 cases have been confirmed, while more than 20 people are showing suspected symptoms.
Overcrowding at this prison and the precarious health conditions of the inmates represent an obstacle to controlling the disease. Experts have warned that without adequate care, the situation could worsen.

Valentina Salcedo, coordinator of the vaccination program for the Pereira Health Secretariat, noted that overcrowding is making it difficult to control the outbreak. ""For the 3 active cases known to the Ministry of Health, they are being monitored constantly, and all measures are being implemented to contain the outbreak. However, it is complex due to overcrowding,"" Salcedo stated.

The health alert was issued after the 1st suspected cases were reported 8 days ago. Authorities have intensified preventive measures within the prison, although available resources remain insufficient. Isolation in Courtyard 5 will continue indefinitely until the situation is under control. Health authorities are expected to confirm or rule out additional suspected cases in the coming days.

The chickenpox outbreak within La 40 prison highlights the urgency of improving health conditions and reducing overcrowding in the country's penitentiary centers. In the meantime, monitoring and providing care to those affected remain a priority.

Cabe recordar que la Gerencia Regional de Salud (Geresa) de Cusco anunciÃ³ el 17 de marzo que emitiÃ³ una alerta epidemiolÃ³gica tras confirmarse dos casos de tos ferina en el distrito de Santiago.

La medida se tomÃ³ a fin de reforzar la vigilancia epidemiolÃ³gica y fortalecer las acciones de prevenciÃ³n y control a nivel regional.

Los pacientes, dos jÃ³venes trabajadores, habrÃ­an contraÃ­do la enfermedad en su centro de labores. Por ello, la Geresa Cusco informÃ³ que ya se encontraba realizando un seguimiento activo de estos casos y del entorno de cada uno para evitar mayores contagios.

 The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is reporting an outbreak of measles in the South Plains and Panhandle regions of Texas. At this time, 309 cases have been identified since late January 2025. Forty of the patients have been hospitalized.
 
 
 
 There has been one fatality in a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area. The child was not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.
 
 
 
 Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.

 Overview
 
 -------
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death. The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 Reports
 
 ------
 
 The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles originating in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is so contagious, additional cases are likely to occur in Lea County and the surrounding communities. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays by noon Mountain Standard Time if there are new cases to report.
 
 
 
 Total cases: 42
 
 Vaccinated with at least 1 dose: 4
 
 Not vaccinated: 30
 
 Unknown: 8

 5-17 years: 10
 
 18+ years: 23

 Total: 42
 
 
 
 Measles is primarily a disease of people who are not immunized and most residents in the outbreak area are protected from measles disease even if they are exposed to the virus. We expect to continue to identify new measles infections associated with this regional outbreak in New Mexico and Texas. This is not the explosive situation that we see with a pandemic where the population is unprotected. The measles cases that we have confirmed include persons with positive laboratory tests and persons who developed measles symptoms at the appropriate time following contact with a confirmed case. These cases were identified in the course of careful (epidemiologic) investigations. The newly added cases include people who were ill previously and were not identified until after their illness. The timing of rash onset for the current 42 cases shows them to be spread out over time and are not increasing dramatically:
 
 
 
 Week 1 (2/9-2/15): 14
 
 Week 2 (2/16-2/22): 6
 
 Week 3 (2/23-3/1): 8
 
 Week 4 (3/2-3/8): 6
 
 Week 5 (3/9-15): 6

More than 370 cases of pertussis (whooping cough) have been reported in the provinces of Iquitos and Datem del MaraÃ±Ã³n after a recent outbreak, according to the Loreto Regional Health Office. Infectious disease specialist Juan Carlos Celis warned that this disease, caused by the _Bordetella pertussis_ bacterium, can be fatal in vulnerable populations. He also questioned the lack of vaccination in remote native communities, with only 40% of the population receiving preventive vaccinations.

It is worth noting that the Regional Health Office (Geresa) of Cusco announced on March 17 [2025] that it had issued an epidemiological alert after confirming 2 cases of whooping cough in the district of Santiago.

The measure was taken to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and prevention and control measures at the regional level. The patients, 2 young workers, reportedly contracted the disease at their workplace. Therefore, Geresa Cusco reported that it was actively monitoring these cases and their surroundings to prevent further spread.

 The Ohio Department of Health has confirmed the state's first measles case of 2025, involving an unvaccinated adult from Ashtabula County who had contact with someone recently returned from international travel. Health officials are now working with the Ashtabula County Health Department to trace potential exposures and promote vaccination opportunities.
 
 
 
 ""The fact that we now have a measles case in Ohio adds emphasis to the importance of being fully vaccinated,"" said Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, Director of the Ohio Department of Health. ""This disease can be very serious, but it is preventable. I strongly encourage you to protect yourselves and your children by getting vaccinated.""
 
 
 
 Ohio experienced 90 measles cases in 2022, with a significant outbreak in Central Ohio accounting for 85 cases. The state reported 1 case in 2023 and 7 in 2024. Measles prevalence has been rising internationally, with ongoing outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico.

 [2] Kansas (Grant & Stevens counties): autochthonous cases

 <https://www.kctv5.com/2025/03/20/kansas-measles-outbreak-grows-6-cases-with-contract-tracing-underway/>
 
 
 
 
 
 The number of measles cases in Kansas increased in the last 2 weeks. According to information provided by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, there are currently 6 active cases in the state. All of the known measles cases are in Grant and Stevens counties, located in the southwest corner of the state near the Oklahoma panhandle. The department said it is not showing how many cases are in each county because there are fewer than 6 cases in each area.
 
 
 
 The cases are split evenly between females and males according to the Kansas Health Data Dashboard. All of the cases are in children and teenagers under the age of 18 years old.
 
 - One case is in a child 4 years old or younger
 
 - Three cases [are] in children between the ages of 5 and 10 years old
 
 - One case is in a child between the ages of 11 and 13 years old
 
 - One case is in a teenager between the ages of 14 and 17 years old
 
 
 
 All of the cases in Kansas at this point are in people who have not been vaccinated, according to the state's health department. Health departments are working on contact tracing because measles [is] so contagious, which the Stevens County Health Department addressed in a social media post. ""Measles is so contagious that if an individual has measles, up to 9 out of 10 of their close contacts who are not protected will also become infected."" Vaccines are available at doctors' offices, clinics, and health departments.

 According to press releases from the National Institute of Public Health and Environment (RIVM), Netherland, 45 new cases of measles were registered in Holland during the previous 2 weeks. 
 
 
 
 A total of 17 of these cases were related to persons who were infected during their visit to Morocco.
 
 
 
 The rise of measles cases in the country is attributed to the drop in vaccination rates as 202 measles were registered in the year 2024 while half of this number is registered since the beginning of 2025.
 
 
 
 France and Spain face a similar situation with regard to imported cases from Morocco.

 'Moroccan measles variant' found in Brussels sewage water
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
 Elke Wollants, lab manager at KU Leuven's Rega Institute, explained that a particularly high concentration of the measles virus was found, with a peak on 11 Mar 2025. However, only 18 cases have been reported in 2025, according to Brussels health institute Vivalis. That's probably an underestimation of the situation, although Wollants points out that this type of measles has a large viral load, which can affect the results.
 
 
 
 Morocco is currently facing a ""historically large"" measles outbreak. Since the end of 2023, more than 25 000 cases have already been recorded in the North African country, resulting in about 120 deaths. The type found in Brussels is the variant of the measles virus which is prevalent in Morocco, the genotype B3. ""The virus is on the rise all over Europe, this is alarming,"" said Wollants. ""The Netherlands already had 45 cases in 2 weeks, and Spain and France are also getting into trouble.""
 
 
 
 According to a recent report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Belgium, with 551 cases, ranks 4th in Europe for the highest number of infections between 1 Feb 2024 and 31 Jan 2025.
 
 
 
 Wollants urges everyone to check their vaccination status. Those born before 1970 have usually had the disease and are therefore protected. Those in their thirties can check their vaccination status via the website <www.myhealth.belgium.be>.
 
 
 
 Because past vaccinations were not always recorded digitally, it is advisable to also check old vaccination cards or GP records. Those who are not or incompletely vaccinated can get a free catch-up vaccination from their GP. A double catch-up vaccination is also recommended in case of doubt.

 The Tennessee Department of Health has reported the state's first cases of measles amid an outbreak in Texas and New Mexico. According to the health department, the individual -- only identified as a Middle Tennessee resident -- is believed to have become infected with measles in early March 2025. The resident is reportedly recovering at home while officials are working to identify the source of the infection and if any other individuals were potentially exposed to the virus.
 
 
 
 As of March 20, 2025, the CDC has confirmed 378 measles cases in at least 18 jurisdictions this year, including Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, and Washington.
 
 
 
 Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. According to the CDC, measles virus can remain infectious in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person leaves an area. Symptoms appear 7 to 14 days after contact with the virus, causing high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash. There's no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.
 
 
 
 Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, thanks to ""the highly effective vaccination program in the United States,"" per the CDC.
 
 
 
 The CDC says the best way to avoid measles is to get the MMR vaccine, which is usually ""administered as the combination measles, mumps and rubella."" Per vaccination recommendations, children should get the first dose at 12 through 15 months, and the second between 4 and 6 years old.
 
 
 
 The Tennessee Department of Health has noticed a drop in the MMR -- or measles mumps and rubella -- vaccination rate for children between 2 and 3 years old.

 [2] California (Tuolumne County): international travelers
 
 Date: Thu 20 Mar 2025 13:40 PDT

 <https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-20/tuolumne-county-confirms-two-measles-cases-warns-of-exposure-at-high-school-and-emergency-room>
 
 
 
 
 
 The Tuolumne County Public Health Department on Wednesday [19 Mar 2025] confirmed 2 measles cases a day after it opened an investigation into the possible infections. The department said the cases involved an adult and a child under 18 who lived in the same household and had traveled internationally. It's unclear whether they had been vaccinated against measles, a highly contagious and potentially deadly disease most often associated with a high fever and rash.
 
 
 
 The department said it was investigating the cases for measles and warned of potential exposure at Summerville High School in Tuolumne on March 10-11 [2025] and at Adventist Health Sonora Emergency Department on the evening of March 15 and morning of March 16. Public health officials issued another update Thursday night warning those who visited the Sonora Sports and Fitness Center's back gym, locker rooms, restrooms and back pool area on March 10 between 3 pm and 7 pm of possible exposure.
 
 
 
 ""We understand that there may be a lot of questions and concerns. The investigation is still ongoing, and we will provide updates as they are available,"" Michelle Jachetta, the county's public health director, said in a Wednesday [19 Mar 2025] statement confirming the cases. ""We want to remind the public that measles is a highly contagious disease and to take steps to protect yourself and your family by ensuring current vaccination status for measles, monitoring for symptoms, and staying home when you feel sick.""
 
 
 
 Michael Merrill, superintendent of Summerville Union High School District, also issued a statement this week that saying the district ""takes the health and safety of its students, staff and our community seriously"" and that the school would work with public health officials ""through the process of identifying any risk."" More than 430 students attend Summerville High School, according to its website.
 
 
 
 The California Department of Public Health reported Thursday [20 Mar 2025] that there have been at least 8 confirmed cases of measles in the state this year. They have not published the locations of the cases.
 
 
 
 Tuolumne County reported some of the state's lower vaccination rates in the 2023-24 school year, according to data published this week by the state public health department. Only 89.8% of Tuolumne County kindergarten students were up to date on all their immunizations, compared with 93.7% of kindergartners statewide. And only 93.1% of kindergarten students had received both doses of their measles, mumps and rubella shots, substantially lower than the 96.2% statewide average. California typically publishes vaccination rates for kindergarten, first-grade and seventh-grade students.
 
 
 
 Public health experts say a 95% vaccination rate, sometimes called ""herd immunity,"" is considered the gold standard of disease prevention. A slip of even 1 or 2 percentage points can create an opportunity for disease to spread, meaning that even if the overwhelming majority of children are vaccinated, it could still take only a few cases to spark an outbreak in an area where immunization rates have fallen below 95%.
 
 
 
 An increase in vaccine hesitancy in recent years, coupled with widespread disinformation online and increasing political division, could make it even harder to encourage immunization, said former state Sen. Richard Pan, a Sacramento Democrat who wrote California's vaccine laws. ""We seem to be heading the wrong direction,"" Pan said. ""We've been feeling pretty comfortable, like 'we're OK.' But we suddenly now prove to people, it's not OK.""

 [The cases were international travelers who were likely unimmunized. One or 2 cases of recognized measles does not, however, necessarily set off an autochthonous outbreak. With measles, having a well-immunized population will prevent this, along with rapid recognition of the index case for isolation and contact identification purposes. It is the same with gastrointestinal diseases such as cholera, but instead of immunization, we are protected by an adequate sewage system. Public health protects us in many ways. - Mod.LL]

 The Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported an additional 4 measles cases in Kansas on Friday [21 Mar 2025]. The most recent cases bring the total for the state up to 10. Cases have now expanded in the state, too. Friday's newly reported cases bring them to Morton, Grant and Stevens counties.
 
 
 
 KDHE reports that all of the cases are in children under the age of 17, and all but one have been unvaccinated; one was under-vaccinated, meaning they had one measles vaccine.
 
 
 
 Dr. Brandan Kennedy with the Kansas Immunization Coalition said that getting the MMR vaccine is the most effective way to protect yourself. KDHE reported that one dose of the vaccine is 93% effective, and 2 doses are 97% effective. ""It's kind of at this point where it's kind of going to do what it's going to do,"" Kennedy said. ""As you've seen, it's gone from 1 to 2 counties in not very much time.""
 
 
 
 It could be soon that doctors could start administering emergency vaccinations for babies. Kennedy said instead of waiting to give the first dose of the MMR vaccine at 1 year, doctors would give it anywhere from 6 months to 1 year. Kennedy stated that individuals who are already up on their dosage are well protected, but the risk is not eliminated.

 <https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/osaka-prefecture-confirms-measles-case-after-vietnam-travel-288067>
 
 
 
 
 
 In a concerning public health alert, Osaka Prefecture has confirmed a measles case involving a man in his 30s who recently traveled to Viet Nam. The announcement, made on March 23, 2025, highlights the potential exposure risk posed to many individuals in a local healthcare setting.
 
 
 
 The patient, identified as having received one dose of the measles vaccine, displayed symptoms of fever, cough, and rash after returning from his trip. Health authorities reported that he visited Yao Municipal Hospital in Yao City between noon and 1 pm on March 21, 2025. During this time, the man potentially came into contact with numerous unspecified people.
 
 
 
 This incident marks the fifth confirmed measles case in Osaka Prefecture in 2025. The prefecture is urging anyone who might have been at the hospital during this time to be vigilant for symptoms, particularly since measles is highly contagious. The incubation period for measles can range from 10 to 12 days, extending up to 21 days in some instances. Therefore, health officials have expressed the need for caution for 3 weeks following contact with the infected individual.
 
 
 
 In the statement released by Osaka health officials, they emphasized, ""If symptoms such as fever or rash appear by April 11 [2025] after using the facility on a potentially infectious date, contact a medical institution in advance, wear a mask, and avoid using public transportation."" This guidance aims to mitigate further spread of the virus, given its highly contagious nature.
 
 
 
 Measles is known to be extremely infectious, spreading through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can remain airborne and infectious for up to 2 hours after the infected person leaves the room. Consequently, individuals who were in close proximity to the patient at the hospital are considered at-risk for developing measles symptoms.
 
 
 
 The patient has since begun recuperating at home under the care of health professionals, indicating that while infections can occur even with vaccination, community health measures are crucial in controlling outbreaks. The last few years have seen a resurgence of measles in various regions, often attributed to low vaccination rates.

 2025 Measles Outbreak Guidance
 
 ------------------------------
 
 
 
 Overview
 
 --------
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.
 
 
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 Reports
 
 -------
 
 The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles originating in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is so contagious, additional cases are likely to occur in Lea County and the surrounding communities. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays by noon Mountain Standard Time if there are new cases to report.
 
 
 
 Total cases: 43
 
 Vaccinated with at least one dose: 4
 
 Not vaccinated: 31
 
 Unknown: 8

 Total: 43
 
 
 
 Measles is primarily a disease of people who are not immunized and most residents in the outbreak area are protected from measles disease even if they are exposed to the virus. We expect to continue to identify new measles infections associated with this regional outbreak in New Mexico and Texas. This is not the explosive situation that we see with a pandemic where the population is unprotected. The measles cases that we have confirmed include persons with positive laboratory tests and persons who developed measles symptoms at the appropriate time following contact with a confirmed case. These cases were identified in the course of careful (epidemiologic) investigations. The newly added cases include people who were ill previously and were not identified until after their illness. The timing of rash onset for the current 43 cases shows them to be spread out over time and are not increasing dramatically [all dates for year 2025]:
 
 
 
 Week 1 (2/9-2/15): 14
 
 Week 2 (2/16-2/22): 6

 The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is reporting an outbreak of measles in the South Plains and Panhandle regions of Texas. At this time, 327 cases have been identified since late January 2025. Forty of the patients have been hospitalized. There has been one fatality in a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area. The child was not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions. Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.

 Vaccination Status of Confirmed Cases in the Outbreak
 
 -----------------------------------------------------
 
 Unvaccinated/Unknown: 325
 
 Vaccinated, 1 dose: 0
 
 Vaccinated, 2+ doses: 2
 
 
 
 Note: The unvaccinated/unknown category includes people with no documented doses of measles vaccine more than 14 days before symptom onset.
 
 
 
 After additional investigation into the details of individual measles cases, DSHS has determined that 3 cases previously classified as vaccinated were not vaccinated cases. Two of those cases got their vaccine doses 1 to 2 days before their symptoms started, after they had been exposed to the virus. It takes the body about 14 days after vaccination to develop immunity to measles, so people aren't considered vaccinated until that 14-day period has passed.
 
 
 
 DSHS has determined that the third case was a Lubbock County resident who had a vaccine reaction rather than a measles infection based on the results of MeVA testing, which detected the vaccine strain. This case has been removed from the case count entirely. The measles vaccine can occasionally cause a reaction with a rash and fever that mimic measles, but it is not a measles infection and cannot spread to other people.
 
 
 
 Measles Prevention
 
 ------------------
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with 2 doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 To get vaccinated, people can go to their health care provider or a pharmacy. Vaccines are also available through the Texas Vaccines for Children and Adult Safety Net Providers. Use the maps located on the measles outbreak page to locate a TVFC or ASN provider. Pharmacies can vaccinate people 14 and older without a prescription. Children under 14 need a prescription to get the MMR vaccine at a pharmacy.

 A measles outbreak that has infected scores of unvaccinated children in southwestern Ontario reportedly had its start at a Mennonite religious gathering in New Brunswick in 2024. In a March 7 [2025] letter to Ontario's health units, the province's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Kieran Moore, said there was ""an exposure at a large gathering with guests from Mennonite communities in New Brunswick last fall.""
 
 
 
 Guests at that gathering unwittingly brought the virus back to southwestern Ontario, mainly the region bordering Norfolk, Oxford and Elgin counties, which has a sizeable conservative Mennonite population. Measles cases then emerged in Manitoba when Mennonites from that province returned home after visiting family in Ontario, Moore said.
 
 
 
 Health officials previously said measles entered Canada on October 16 [2024] when an infected traveler flew to New Brunswick from the Philippines, with stops in Vancouver and Toronto. But how the highly contagious respiratory virus got to southwestern Ontario had been unclear prior to Moore's memorandum.
 
 
 
 The latest report from Public Health Ontario, released on Thursday [20 Mar 2025], says Southwestern Public Health has seen 223 confirmed measles cases since last October 2024, with another 111 cases in Grand Erie. Taken together, those outbreaks account for almost three-quarters of Ontario's confirmed cases, nearly all of which are in unvaccinated residents, Moore said.
 
 
 
 Health officials in West Texas grappling with a deadly measles outbreak in that state have blamed low vaccination rates in Mennonite communities for the spread of the disease. But authorities in Grand Erie and Southwestern have refrained from publicly identifying vaccine hesitancy among the area's conservative Mennonite population as a reason for the local spike in cases. However, a list of measles exposure sites in Grand Erie includes a church and several private Christian schools in western Norfolk County catering to Old Colony Mennonites, and Moore's letter confirmed the link.
 
 
 
 ""Cases could spread in any unvaccinated community or population but are disproportionately affecting some Mennonite, Amish, and other Anabaptist communities due to a combination of under-immunization and exposure to measles in certain areas,"" Moore wrote.
 
 
 
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, leaders of Mennonite Church Canada advised its members there was nothing in the Bible or church teachings that justified a religious exemption from the vaccine. A spokesperson for Mennonite Church Canada's eastern chapter -- which includes Ontario and New Brunswick -- told The Spectator that Old Colony Mennonites are ""not a part of our denomination."" She did not respond when asked about her organization's current message to members regarding the measles vaccine.
 
 
 
 ""The provincial vaccine supply is being monitored and additional doses of vaccines are being ordered as needed,"" Moore told Ontario's medical officers.
 
 
 
 Measles cases have popped up in 11 health units and the city of Hamilton so far this year [2025], with Southwestern's medical officer of health, Dr. Ninh Tran, telling reporters many of those cases are linked to the outbreak in his region and Grand Erie. While most people who catch the measles will recover at home, the virus can destroy a patient's immune system and in severe cases cause brain damage and deafness.

 <https://www.premiumtimesng.com/health/health-news/783181-diphtheria-nigeria-records-three-new-confirmed-cases-one-death.html>
 
 
 
 
 
 The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) has recorded 3 new confirmed cases and one death of diphtheria. The centre made this known in its latest situation report for week 11.
 
 
 
 NCDC stated that the cases were identified among 16 suspected cases across 4 local government areas (LGAs) in 2 states. The agency noted that all the 3 confirmed cases were clinically diagnosed, with no laboratory confirmations or epidemiological links reported.
 
 
 
 Also, it stated that the death accounted for a case fatality rate (CFR) of 33.3%.
 
 
 
 More details
 
 ------------
 
 Since epidemiological week 19 of 2022, Nigeria has recorded 42 805 suspected diphtheria cases across 351 LGAs in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Of these, 25 977 cases (60.7%) have been confirmed, comprising 396 laboratory-confirmed cases, 238 epidemiologically linked cases, and 25 353 clinically compatible cases.
 
 
 
 The report revealed that states with the highest number of suspected cases include Kano (24 385), Yobe (5330), Katsina (4253), Bauchi (3066), Borno (3059), Kaduna (777), and Jigawa (364), which accounted for 96.3% of the total suspected cases.
 
 
 
 The confirmed cases have been reported in 187 LGAs across 26 states, with Kano (18 254), Bauchi (2334), Yobe (2383), Katsina (1517), Borno (1161), Jigawa (53), Plateau (119), and Kaduna (44) accounting for 99.1% of these cases.
 
 
 
 NCDC stated that most confirmed cases, 16 579 (63.8%), occurred among children aged 1 to 14 years. The NCDC has expressed concern over persistent vaccination gaps, which have contributed to the ongoing outbreak.
 
 
 
 As of the latest reports, a total of 1319 deaths have been recorded among confirmed cases, reflecting a CFR of 5.1%.
 
 
 
 Public health response
 
 ----------------------
 
 In response to the outbreak, the NCDC, in collaboration with international partners such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF, has intensified public health interventions.
 
 
 
 These efforts include enhanced surveillance, widespread vaccination campaigns targeting unvaccinated populations, and public awareness initiatives to educate communities about the importance of immunisation and early medical intervention.
 
 
 
 The NCDC urged the public to ensure that children receive the complete series of diphtheria vaccinations as part of routine immunisation schedules. Healthcare workers are also advised to maintain a high index of suspicion for diphtheria and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control measures to mitigate the spread of the disease.
 
 
 
 About diphtheria
 
 ----------------
 
 Diphtheria is a severe bacterial infection caused by _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_. It primarily affects the throat and upper airways, producing a toxin that can lead to breathing difficulties, heart complications, and nerve damage.
 
 
 
 The disease is highly contagious and spreads through respiratory droplets, direct contact, or contaminated surfaces. Diphtheria can be prevented through vaccination, part of routine immunisation schedules worldwide.

 Seventeen children died of measles infection in Sindh in the last 2 months, ARY News reported, citing a statement by the health department. Ten children died in Khairpur district of Sindh by measles in 2 months.
 
 
 
 Sindh Health Department has said that over 1100 cases of the infectious disease reported in Sindh from January 1 to March 8 this year [2025]. In last 2 months, 550 children reported infected by measles in Karachi, according to the health department.
 
 
 
 Khairpur district has maximum death toll by measles, where 10 children died of the infectious disease, ARY News reported. Meanwhile, 5 children died of the infection in Karachi's East district, while one each in Sukkur and Jacobabad districts.
 
 
 
 The main reason of children's deaths by the infection is avoiding vaccination and lack of awareness about the infection, which has been otherwise vaccine-preventable disease, doctors said.
 
 
 
 ""Daily, 4 to 6 measles patients [are] being reported at government hospitals,"" hospital officials earlier told ARY News. Hospital officials said that children under 5 years contract measles and some children with pneumonia caused by measles have been admitted at hospitals.
 
 
 
 A measles outbreak in Khairpur district claimed lives of 7 children within a span of 2 days, ARY News reported.
 
 
 
 It is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable infectious disease caused by measles virus. The disease symptoms usually develop 10-12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7-10 days. The symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Small white spots may form inside the mouth 2 or 3 days after the start of symptoms. A red, flat rash which starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body begins 3-5 days after the start of symptoms.
 
 
 
 Common complications include diarrhea, middle ear infection, and pneumonia.
 
 
 
 On December 31, 2024, Pakistan health department data confirmed the deaths of 132 children in the year with more than 13 000 suspected and 6670 confirmed cases. Surprisingly, it shows only 3 deaths in Karachi, Dawn reported.

 Two measles cases have been confirmed in Erie County. Both are linked to travel
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Measles has arrived in Erie County. The Erie County Department of Health reported Monday [24 Mar 2025] that 2 cases of measles have been confirmed in Erie County residents. Both cases have been linked to international travel.
 
 
 
 While more than 350 measles cases in the USA have been reported this year [2025] to the CDC, there's no indication yet of a more widespread problem in northwestern Pennsylvania. According to a news release, ""At this time, the Erie County Department of Health (ECDH) does not have reason to believe there is a high risk of community spread or exposures in relation to these cases.""
 
 
 
 The Ohio Department of Health reported last week that Ohio's 1st case of measles this year [2025] had been confirmed in Ashtabula County, located just west of Erie County. The Ohio case involved an unvaccinated adult who had been in contact with someone who traveled outside the country.
 
 
 
 The Health Department didn't say in its announcement whether the 2 people infected here had been vaccinated. The local Health Department did stress, however, the importance of being vaccinated against the highly contagious respiratory infection.

 DC Health officials confirm measles case in the District
 
 --------------------------------------------------------
 
 The DC Department of Health confirmed Tuesday [25 Mar 2025] a positive case of measles in a person who visited various locations in the District while contagious. The unidentified person traveled throughout the nation's capital within the last week.
 
 
 
 Potential exposure sites outlined by the District's health department include 2 Amtrak locations and an urgent care location:
 
 
 
 Amtrak Northeast Regional 175 Train Southbound
 
 19 Mar 2025, 7:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.
 
 Amtrak Concourse, Union Station, 50 Massachusetts Ave, NE
 
 19 Mar 2025, 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.
 
 MedStar Urgent Care Adams Morgan, 1805 Columbia Road, NW
 
 22 Mar 2025, 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.
 
 
 
 Anyone not immune to measles who traveled to the potential exposure sites during the noted dates and times are urged to contact their health care provider or DCHealth at 844-493-2652 for guidance.
 
 
 
 DC Health's alert comes weeks after health officials in Maryland confirmed 3 measles cases across Howard and Prince George's counties. All 3 cases had been contracted by residents who had traveled abroad, and were not related to the outbreaks in New Mexico, Texas or Oklahoma.
 
 
 
 Details surrounding the latest confirmed measles case have not yet been provided. It remains unclear whether international travel is at all linked to the DC case. A measles case was previously reported in the District in July 2024.

 <https://www.premiumtimesng.com/health/health-news/783181-diphtheria-nigeria-records-three-new-confirmed-cases-one-death.html>
 
 
 
 
 
 The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) has recorded 3 new confirmed cases and one death of diphtheria. The centre made this known in its latest situation report for week 11.
 
 
 
 NCDC stated that the cases were identified among 16 suspected cases across 4 local government areas (LGAs) in 2 states. The agency noted that all the 3 confirmed cases were clinically diagnosed, with no laboratory confirmations or epidemiological links reported.
 
 
 
 Also, it stated that the death accounted for a case fatality rate (CFR) of 33.3%.
 
 
 
 More details
 
 ------------
 
 Since epidemiological week 19 of 2022, Nigeria has recorded 42 805 suspected diphtheria cases across 351 LGAs in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Of these, 25 977 cases (60.7%) have been confirmed, comprising 396 laboratory-confirmed cases, 238 epidemiologically linked cases, and 25 353 clinically compatible cases.
 
 
 
 The report revealed that states with the highest number of suspected cases include Kano (24 385), Yobe (5330), Katsina (4253), Bauchi (3066), Borno (3059), Kaduna (777), and Jigawa (364), which accounted for 96.3% of the total suspected cases.
 
 
 
 The confirmed cases have been reported in 187 LGAs across 26 states, with Kano (18 254), Bauchi (2334), Yobe (2383), Katsina (1517), Borno (1161), Jigawa (53), Plateau (119), and Kaduna (44) accounting for 99.1% of these cases.
 
 
 
 NCDC stated that most confirmed cases, 16 579 (63.8%), occurred among children aged 1 to 14 years. The NCDC has expressed concern over persistent vaccination gaps, which have contributed to the ongoing outbreak.
 
 
 
 As of the latest reports, a total of 1319 deaths have been recorded among confirmed cases, reflecting a CFR of 5.1%.
 
 
 
 Public health response
 
 ----------------------
 
 In response to the outbreak, the NCDC, in collaboration with international partners such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF, has intensified public health interventions.
 
 
 
 These efforts include enhanced surveillance, widespread vaccination campaigns targeting unvaccinated populations, and public awareness initiatives to educate communities about the importance of immunisation and early medical intervention.
 
 
 
 The NCDC urged the public to ensure that children receive the complete series of diphtheria vaccinations as part of routine immunisation schedules. Healthcare workers are also advised to maintain a high index of suspicion for diphtheria and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control measures to mitigate the spread of the disease.
 
 
 
 About diphtheria
 
 ----------------
 
 Diphtheria is a severe bacterial infection caused by _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_. It primarily affects the throat and upper airways, producing a toxin that can lead to breathing difficulties, heart complications, and nerve damage.
 
 
 
 The disease is highly contagious and spreads through respiratory droplets, direct contact, or contaminated surfaces. Diphtheria can be prevented through vaccination, part of routine immunisation schedules worldwide.

 Ontario measles case count hits 572, up by more than 100 in past week
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Measles cases keep climbing in Ontario, as the province counts more than 100 new cases in the past week.
 
 
 
 Public Health Ontario is now reporting 572 confirmed and suspected cases since the outbreak began in October 2024. That's an increase of 102 cases since 20 Mar 2025. Of those cases, 42 people are in the hospital, including 2 people seeking intensive care. The outbreak, which is still predominantly in Southwestern and Grand Erie public health units, has also spread to Waterloo and Lambton. In Chatham-Kent, cases have nearly doubled to 39 in the past week, and the spread continues in Huron Perth where 55 people are sick.
 
 
 
 Outbreaks are also being monitored in other provinces, though the case counts are smaller -- in Alberta 18 people are diagnosed, most of them minors. The latest numbers in Quebec are unchanged at 40 cases since last week.
 
 
 
 Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. The World Health Organization says the virus can remain active in the air or on infected surfaces for up to 2 hours. It usually begins with a fever, cough, runny nose and red watery eyes, followed by a red blotchy rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body and limbs. The virus can lead to pneumonia, inflammation of the brain and death.

 Measles cases more than double in Kansas
 
 -------------------------------------
 
 The number of measles cases in Kansas has jumped to 23, up from 10 last week. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment is calling it a measles outbreak. So far, most cases are in southwest Kansas, but they have started spreading east as far as Kiowa County. Kiowa and Stevens counties both have 6 cases, while Grant, Gray, Haskell, and Morton counties have one to 5 cases. All of the cases are children, except 2. Twenty of the measles patients have never been vaccinated.
 
 
 
 The KDHE says the outbreak will be declared over after 42 days with no new cases. Measles can cause serious health complications, especially in children younger than 5. So far, no Kansas cases have required hospitalization.
 
 
 
 According to the CDC, measles is highly contagious. The virus can linger in the air for up to 2 hours. The KDHE says the first symptoms happen 7 to 14 days after exposure. Measles typically begins with a high fever, possibly spiking to more than 104 [deg F/40 deg C], a cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. Tiny white spots [Koplik's spots - Mod.LL] may appear inside the mouth 2 to 3 days after the symptoms begin.
 
 
 
 The measles rash appears 3 to 5 days after symptoms begin. Flat red spots appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet.

 Measles outbreak reported in Ohio after several more cases confirmed
 
 -----------------------------------------
 
 The Ohio Department of Health on Wednesday [26 Mar 2025] reported a measles outbreak in the state after several more cases were confirmed. There are 10 measles cases in Ashtabula County and one case in Knox County, according to ODH. Nine of the measles cases in Ashtabula County were linked to an adult male, who was confirmed last week as the state's first measles case of the year [2025]. The confirmed case in Knox County exposed others in Knox and nearby counties, officials said. Knox Public Health said the case was in an international traveler who was visiting the county. That person is no longer infectious after completing their isolation period.
 
 
 
 ""KPH is also working with the individual and their healthcare provider to identify contacts,"" according to a news release. ""KPH will notify the contacts and provide guidance on post-exposure prophylaxis and quarantine.""
 
 
 
 None of the individuals were vaccinated, according to ODH.
 
 
 
 Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff encouraged parents to get their children vaccinated, as children are at a higher risk.
 
 
 
 ""Given the measles activity in Texas, New Mexico, and other states around the country, we're disappointed but not surprised we now have several cases in Ohio and known exposure in some counties,"" Vanderhoff said in a statement. ""This disease can be very serious, even deadly, but it is almost entirely avoidable by being properly vaccinated.
 
 
 
 ""I strongly urge all parents across Ohio to make sure your children are vaccinated,"" he said. ""It is a crucial layer of protection that can save lives.""
 
 
 
 According to the CDC, a measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases. The disease spreads quickly and is extremely contagious. The virus can survive in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person coughs or sneezes.

 Minnesota's first case of measles this year identified during travel to DC
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Minnesota has reported its first case of measles this year [2025] in someone who may have spread the highly infectious disease to others while traveling in Washington, DC.
 
 
 
 DC Health issued an alert Tuesday [25 Mar 2025] saying the individual had visited multiple locations and may have exposed others on 19 Mar [2025] while riding an Amtrak train or walking through a concourse at Union Station in Washington. The individual sought treatment on Saturday [21 Mar 2025] at a DC urgent care location, making it a third possible exposure site.
 
 
 
 ""The individual was not infectious while in Minnesota,"" said Jayne Griffith, an infectious disease epidemiologist for the Minnesota Department of Health. ""We are still investigating where this individual may have acquired measles.""

 A variant of the measles virus prevalent in Morocco has been found in sewage water in Brussels, research conducted by KU Leuven reveals. Elke Wollants, lab manager at Leuven University's Rega Institute, has identified the variant of the virus found as genotype B3, the so-called ""Moroccan variant.""
 
 
 
 Wollants speaks of a particularly high concentration of the measles virus, peaking on 11 Mar [2025]. Enquiries by the researcher at Brussels health institute Vivalis reveal that only 18 cases have been reported so far this year [2025].
 
 
 
 ""That‚Äôs probably an underestimate,"" she says, though she also points out that this type of measles has a large viral load, which may influence the results.
 
 
 
 Morocco is currently facing a ""historically large"" measles outbreak. Since the end of 2023, more than 25 000 cases have been recorded in the North African country, resulting in about 120 deaths.
 
 
 
 The genotype B3, also found in Brussels, ""is on the rise all over Europe. This is alarming. The Netherlands already counted 45 cases in 2 weeks, and Spain and France are also in trouble,"" Wollants warns.
 
 
 
 According to a recent report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Belgium, with 551 cases, ranks 4th in Europe for the highest number of infections between 1 Feb 2024 and 31 Jan 2025.
 
 
 
 Wollants calls on everyone to check their vaccination status. People born before 1970 have usually had the disease and are therefore protected. People in their 30s can check their vaccination status via <myhealth.be>. Since past vaccinations were not always recorded digitally, it is advisable also to check old vaccination cards or GP records. People who are not (or are incompletely) vaccinated can get a free catch-up vaccination from their GP. A double catch-up vaccination is also recommended in case of doubt.

 Measles Outbreak - 28 Mar 2025
 
 ------------------------------
 
 The Texas Department of State Health Services is reporting an outbreak of measles in the South Plains and Panhandle regions of Texas. At this time, 400 cases have been identified since late January 2025. Forty-one of the patients have been hospitalized. There has been 1 fatality in a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area. The child was not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions. Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.

 Measles Prevention
 
 ------------------
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with 2 doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 To get vaccinated, people can go to their health care provider or a pharmacy. Vaccines are also available through the Texas Vaccines for Children and Adult Safety Net Providers. Use the maps located on the measles outbreak page to locate a TVFC or ASN provider. Pharmacies can vaccinate people 14 and older without a prescription. Children under 14 need a prescription to get the MMR vaccine at a pharmacy.

 A case of the measles has been identified in a Bucks County resident. The Bucks County Health Department announced Thursday [27 Mar 2025] that a local tested positive for the disease on Wednesday evening [26 Mar 2025]. It's the county's first reported case of the measles since 2017, said James O'Malley, spokesperson for the Bucks County Health Department.
 
 
 
 The individual, according to the county, is a vaccinated adult who recently traveled to Texas and visited several locations throughout the region while potentially contagious. The person's symptoms were mild, the county said.
 
 
 
 The health department has asked anyone who visited the Starbucks along South Eagle Road in Newtown between 10:50 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. March 19 [2025] to monitor for symptoms. These include a cough, runny nose, red eyes, headache, sneezing and a red skin rash starting on the face and neck. Symptoms typically begin within 10-14 days of exposure.
 
 
 
 ""Two doses of the vaccine will be 97% effective in preventing all illness. However, even though a vaccinated person can still get measles, they are more likely to experience a mild illness and are thus less likely to spread it,"" said Dr. David Damsker, county health department director.

 A San Mateo County resident contracted measles in February 2025 after traveling, marking the first case of the highly contagious virus to appear in the county in recent years, a San Mateo County Health spokesperson confirmed. It's unclear where the resident was traveling from or the specific manner in which the virus was transmitted. San Mateo County Communications Officer Preston Merchant declined to share more information about the case, citing privacy laws.
 
 
 
 As of March 25 [2025], 8 measles cases have been confirmed in 6 California counties: Fresno, Los Angeles, Orange, Placer, Tuolumne and San Mateo. While the health department knew of the case in February 2025, it did not notify the public because ""our investigators were able to reach everyone considered a potential exposure, and there was no further public risk,"" Merchant said.
 
 
 
 The California Conference of Local Health Officers recommends that jurisdictions release information about cases of novel illnesses to the public. Guidelines say health officials can release some information about cases, including age, date of symptoms and severity. When asked to share such details, Merchant declined.
 
 
 
 On March 16 [2025], San Mateo County joined other Bay Area counties in recommending people get vaccinated for measles due to an ongoing outbreak in Texas. The press release did not mention the case in San Mateo County.

The Shelby County Health Department has activated its emergency plans and will contact any persons who may have been exposed to the measles virus, state health officials said. ""At this time, the risk to the general public is considered to be low,"" state officials said.
 
 
 
 Shelby County Health Department Director Dr. Michelle Taylor recommends checking with your healthcare provider to determine your MMR vaccination status. Adults who were not vaccinated as children should get at least one dose of the MMR vaccine. Those at high risk because they work in education or health care should get 2 doses, 28 days apart.
 
 
 
 ""So really what we are talking about are those people who can't vaccinate yet because they are small babies and they haven't gotten to 12 months yet or immunocompromised people or people who never had a MMR vaccine,"" said Taylor. Dr. Taylor said that while she understands hesitancy with any vaccine, this is the most effective treatment.
 
 
 
 ""Now we are at a point [where people] have chosen not to vaccinate and we are starting to see diseases that our grandparents and our great-grandparents experienced because there was not a vaccine available when they were children and that is very alarming,"" said Taylor.
 
 
 
 Health officials say measles ""is a highly infectious respiratory virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, talks, or sneezes. Measles is known for causing a red, spotty rash that starts on the face and spreads downward on the body. Other symptoms can include fever, headache, and fatigue, often followed by rash, red eyes, and congestion.""
 
 
 
 It is not clear how the Memphian was exposed, but Shelby County doctors are carefully checking where this latest patient has been to identify others who may have been exposed.

 Viet Nam's major hospitals brace for measles outbreak amid surge in cases
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 As the measles outbreak continues to escalate across Viet Nam, top Hanoi hospitals have admitted both children and adults in critical condition, with the unvaccinated making up the majority of severe cases.
 
 
 
 A Ministry of Health task force reported a concerning rise in measles cases during their Thursday [27 Mar 2025] visits to major hospitals in Hanoi to inspect screening, triage, and treatment systems for measles patients.
 
 
 
 At the Vietnam National Children's Hospital, nearly 2700 measles patients have been recorded since 2024, including 1894 cases in the first quarter of 2025. According to Cao Viet Tung, the hospital's deputy director, about 60 percent of the patients were either unvaccinated or too young to receive the vaccine.
 
 
 
 Each day, the hospital sees up to 90 suspected measles cases, with some days exceeding 100. Tung said the hospital already set up triage systems from the outpatient department and is preparing to handle more cases and support lower-tier hospitals if the outbreak worsens.
 
 
 
 Since 2024, the hospital has reported 13 measles-related deaths, often among children with complicated underlying conditions such as pneumonia, premature birth, metabolic disorders, or meningitis.
 
 
 
 Tung expressed his concerns about overcrowded wards, a shortage of standard isolation rooms, and difficulties in the triage process due to space limits.
 
 
 
 Moreover, measles symptoms are often atypical, making diagnosis more challenging. Close contact within families further complicates infection control.
 
 
 
 Since late 2024, Bach Mai Hospital's Center for Tropical Diseases has treated 104 measles patients, many in serious condition. Among them, 2 required mechanical ventilation and one needed ECMO support. Alarmingly, 75 percent of the patients were unsure of their vaccination status.
 
 
 
 Do Duy Cuong, director of the Center for Tropical Diseases, said the center receives 10 to 20 adult measles patients daily, some with severe complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, elevated liver enzymes, diarrhea, or even encephalitis. Most cases involve individuals who were either unvaccinated or had missed booster shots.
 
 
 
 Cuong emphasized that measles spreads rapidly through respiratory droplets and has one of the highest infection rates among communicable diseases. Immediate isolation is crucial once diagnosed, he said. He noted that about 5 percent of hospital cases involve severe complications requiring mechanical ventilation, dialysis, or intensive care -- especially in patients with chronic illnesses or weakened immunity.
 
 
 
 Deputy Minister of Health Tran Van Thuan urged hospitals to prepare for all outbreak scenarios. Facilities must develop contingency plans for isolating and treating patients based on outbreak scale and severity. He stressed the need to coordinate department capacity and infection control to reduce cross-contamination risks if the epidemic escalates.

 Measles case confirmed in Brown County
 
 -------------------------------------
 
 A case of the measles has been confirmed in Brown County. Brown County Health Department officials released information on the case Friday [28 Mar 2025], saying the patient's identifying information will be withheld. Measles, an airborne virus that is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, is especially dangerous for babies and young children.
 
 
 
 A press release from the Brown County Health Department explains, ""Measles is highly contagious, and if one person has it, 9 out of 10 people around that person will also become infected if they're not yet vaccinated."" Health officials recommend immunization as the top prevention measure against measles.
 
 
 
 Texas has been experiencing a measles outbreak in 2025, with more than 400 cases being identified in the Panhandle and far West Texas since January. This case is the first confirmed to have reached the Big Country. Anyone with questions about the measles is asked to contact Brownwood-Brown County Health Department at (325)646-0554.

 Few weeks after the report of the diphtheria outbreak at Kings College annex, Victoria Island, the Lagos State government has officially confirmed 10 cases of diphtheria between January 1 and March 27, 2025. Meanwhile, the state health authorities have intensified efforts to control the outbreak.
 
 
 
 Giving an update on the development on Sunday [30 Mar 2025] by the State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, the number of suspected cases fluctuated significantly during the period, with some days seeing as many as 15 cases reported.
 
 
 
 Abayomi revealed that laboratory tests on 76 samples confirmed 10 cases of diphtheria, while 63 returned negative results. ""Three additional samples collected on March 26 [2025] are still awaiting results,"" he noted.
 
 
 
 According to him, the outbreak has affected several local government areas (LGAs), with Eti-Osa recording the highest number of suspected cases at 44. Other LGAs impacted include Alimosho, Badagry, Ikorodu, Kosofe, Ojo, Mushin, and Lagos Island, which have reported varying numbers of suspected and confirmed cases.
 
 
 
 To prevent further transmission, Abayomi emphasised that all confirmed cases are required to remain in treatment. ""We urge the public to cooperate with health authorities, as these measures are critical to stopping the spread of the disease,"" he said.
 
 
 
 ""As part of the ongoing response, 21 individuals have received diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) treatment, with the highest number of recipients -- 14 -- coming from King's College in Eti-Osa. Additional beneficiaries include those from Lagos State Model School in Meiran and various locations in Alimosho, Kosofe, and Badagry.""
 
 
 
 The Commissioner further stressed a positive trend: ""Although we saw a peak in cases in the third, fourth, and 10th weeks of 2025, the recent decline in case numbers suggests that our containment measures may be starting to take effect.""
 
 
 
 He said efforts to track the spread of the disease are also progressing. ""We have identified 118 individuals as potential contacts of confirmed cases. Of these, follow-up has been completed for 100, with 18 still pending. Additionally, 36 individuals across the affected LGAs have received prophylactic treatment,"" Abayomi explained.
 
 
 
 He said confirmed cases have been linked to various locations, including King's College in Eti-Osa, Lagos State Model School in Alimosho, and Lagos University Teaching Hospital in Mushin. ""These areas will remain focal points for intensified interventions, including targeted vaccination campaigns and public health awareness,"" he added.
 
 
 
 Abayomi further disclosed that vaccination efforts continue, with 36 310 individuals vaccinated so far, including 13 633 healthcare workers. ""We are particularly focused on vaccinating close contacts of confirmed cases, suspected patients, and frontline health workers,"" he said.
 
 
 
 As Lagosians prepare for Eid-el-Fitr, Easter celebrations, and the second-term school vacation, Abayomi urged the public to take extra precautions. ""During this festive period, maintaining high levels of hygiene is critical. Wash your hands regularly, use sanitizers, and avoid crowded places,"" he advised.
 
 
 
 The Commissioner also stressed the importance of prompt reporting of symptoms such as fever, sore throat, runny nose, and neck swelling. ""Reporting symptoms early can save lives and help prevent further transmission of diphtheria."" He explained that treatment is available free of charge at government health facilities.
 
 
 
 Abayomi commended Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for his swift and strategic intervention in addressing the outbreak and acknowledged the support of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), WHO, and UNICEF. ""We continue to work closely with our partners to provide technical assistance and resources,"" he said.
 
 
 
 The state government remains committed to monitoring the situation and has assured residents that it will continue to intensify surveillance, treatment, and prevention efforts. ""We will keep residents informed and urge everyone to adhere to public health advisories to help mitigate this outbreak,"" Abayomi added.

 Overview
 
 --------
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.
 
 
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 Reports
 
 -------
 
 The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles originating in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is so contagious, additional cases are likely to occur in Lea County and the surrounding communities. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays by noon Mountain Standard Time if there are new cases to report.
 
 
 
 Total cases: 48
 
 Vaccinated with at least one dose: 5
 
 Not vaccinated: 33
 
 Unknown: 10

 Measles is primarily a disease of people who are not immunized and most residents in the outbreak area are protected from measles disease even if they are exposed to the virus. We expect to continue to identify new measles infections associated with this regional outbreak in New Mexico and Texas. This is not the explosive situation that we see with a pandemic where the population is unprotected. The measles cases that we have confirmed include persons with positive laboratory tests and persons who developed measles symptoms at the appropriate time following contact with a confirmed case. These cases were identified in the course of careful (epidemiologic) investigations. The newly added cases include people who were ill previously and were not identified until after their illness. The timing of rash onset for the current 48 cases shows them to be spread out over time and are not increasing dramatically:
 
 
 
 Week 1 (2/9-2/15): 14
 
 Week 2 (2/16-2/22): 6

 Measles Prevention
 
 ------------------
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with 2 doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 To get vaccinated, people can go to their health care provider or a pharmacy. Vaccines are also available through the Texas Vaccines for Children and Adult Safety Net Providers. Use the maps located on the measles outbreak page to locate a TVFC or ASN provider. Pharmacies can vaccinate people 14 and older without a prescription. Children under 14 need a prescription to get the MMR vaccine at a pharmacy.

 Overview
 
 --------
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.
 
 
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 Reports
 
 -------
 
 The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles originating in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is so contagious, additional cases are likely to occur in Lea County and the surrounding communities. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays by noon Mountain Standard Time if there are new cases to report.
 
 
 
 Total cases: 54
 
 Vaccinated with at least one dose: 6
 
 Not vaccinated: 36
 
 Unknown: 12

 Measles is primarily a disease of people who are not immunized and most residents in the outbreak area are protected from measles disease even if they are exposed to the virus. We expect to continue to identify new measles infections associated with this regional outbreak in New Mexico and Texas. This is not the explosive situation that we see with a pandemic where the population is unprotected. The measles cases that we have confirmed include persons with positive laboratory tests and persons who developed measles symptoms at the appropriate time following contact with a confirmed case. These cases were identified in the course of careful (epidemiologic) investigations. The newly added cases include people who were ill previously and were not identified until after their illness. The timing of rash onset for the current 54 cases shows them to be spread out over time and are not increasing dramatically:
 
 
 
 Week 1 (2/9-2/15): 14
 
 Week 2 (2/16-2/22): 6
 
 Week 3 (2/23-3/1): 8

 Measles Prevention
 
 ------------------
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with 2 doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 To get vaccinated, people can go to their health care provider or a pharmacy. Vaccines are also available through the Texas Vaccines for Children and Adult Safety Net Providers. Use the maps located on the measles outbreak page to locate a TVFC or ASN provider. Pharmacies can vaccinate people 14 and older without a prescription. Children under 14 need a prescription to get the MMR vaccine at a pharmacy.

 The measles outbreak continues to wreak havoc in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2025. From the beginning of the year to mid-March, a total of 12 074 cases and 199 deaths have been recorded in health facilities across more than 27 health zones affected by the disease, with a case fatality rate of 1.60%.
 
 
 
 Eleven of the country's 26 provinces are officially experiencing an outbreak, according to the Ministry of Health. Haut-Katanga Province remains the most affected, with over 11 health zones impacted. It is followed by the Tanganyika and √âquateur provinces, each with 3 affected health zones.
 
 
 
 Nord-Ubangi Province is the most severely impacted in terms of fatality, with a case fatality rate of 7.32%, followed by Tshopo, √âquateur, and Tanganyika.
 
 
 
 Since August 2010, the Democratic Republic of Congo has been facing recurrent measles outbreaks in nearly all its provinces. Among the key challenges in eliminating measles outbreaks are the mobilization of resources for targeted outbreak response, and the strengthening of the National Reference Laboratory's capacity (including training providers on genotyping and supplying laboratory consumables).

 Infants too young for MMR vaccine among those exposed to Erie County's 3rd measles case
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Infants too young to receive the measles vaccine were exposed to the highly contagious virus last week at a Millcreek Township childcare center. A male child was diagnosed with measles, Erie County's 3rd confirmed case, Erie County Department of Health officials announced Sunday [30 Mar 2025]. The boy, whose age was not disclosed, is ""recovering well,"" said Erin Mrenak, County Health Department director.
 
 
 
 County health officials are contacting people who possibly were exposed to the measles virus at 2 locations last week. One is Creative Learning Childcare, 2312 W. 15th St., and the other is UPMC Children's Express Care, 3330 Peach St. Both centers have been cooperating with the County Health Department's investigation, Mrenak said. The timetable for exposure at the childcare center was Tuesday through Thursday [25 to 27 Mar 2025], while the timetable for the urgent-care center was Friday [28 Mar 2025] from 5:45 p.m. until closing.
 
 
 
 ""There were some children (at the childcare center) who were under 1 year old,"" Mrenak said, referring to the minimum age at which children usually receive their 1st measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. ""These are now our highest priority. We have nurses reaching out to their families as part of our disease investigation and contact tracing.""
 
 
 
 It is the county's 3rd reported measles case within a week after not having a confirmed case since 1991. The first 2 cases were adults with limited exposure to other people. ""We don't have an exact number of total people who were exposed but it is ... more than dozens,"" Mrenak said. ""No other cases have been found yet.""

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Non-toxigenic _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, a Gram-positive, aerobic bacillus frequently linked to wound infections, is an uncommon cause of infective endocarditis [1,2]. This presentation has historically been associated with underlying cardiac risk factors and often a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) [3]. While active surveillance of non-toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ is not conducted in England, an increase in clinical reports of non-toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ causing severe infective endocarditis noted by a tertiary referral endocarditis centre in early January 2025 led the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to launch an investigation. Retrospective and prospective case findings were initiated. Here, we describe the findings so far.
 
 
 
 Epidemiological investigation and laboratory findings
 
 --------------------------------------
 
 A confirmed case was defined as any person with radiological evidence (echocardiographic) of infective endocarditis, _C. diphtheriae_ isolated from a sterile site and a non-toxigenic strain confirmed by the national reference laboratory at UKHSA, Colindale, London.
 
 
 
 Initial case-finding using the national diphtheria surveillance and laboratory datasets identified 5 cases with onset from July 2024 to January 2025, all in London and neighboring regions, and with no more than one case per month. All were male, and the majority were young (median age: 30‚Äâ years; range: early 20s to early 50s). All cases had a history of smoking or nasal insufflation of heroin, crack cocaine, or powdered cocaine. Although all individuals reported no IVDU, 2 acknowledged past use, and there were no clinical stigmata of injection. Of the 5 cases, 3 experienced street homelessness in London. One case reported living in shared accommodation, and another reported living in private housing. No clear epidemiological link between cases has been identified. Two of the individuals who experienced homelessness were found collapsed on the street.
 
 
 
 Non-toxin-producing _C. diphtheriae_ was isolated from blood culture for all cases. Whole-genome sequencing and subsequent multilocus sequence type (MLST) analysis identified 4 ST559 [ST = sequence type. - Mod.LL] and 1 ST8 isolate [4]. Core-genome MLST (cgMLST) analysis, using the _Corynebacterium_ schema, revealed large distances, with 959 allelic differences separating ST559 and ST8 isolates (Figure [for figures/tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]) [5].
 
 
 
 Antibacterial treatment and clinical characteristics
 
 -------------------------------------
 
 Local hospital antibacterial susceptibility testing revealed that isolates from all respective individuals had benzylpenicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in the susceptible, increased exposure range (Table 1). Individual hospitals performed testing in line with UK Standards of Microbiological Investigations and interpreted MIC results according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoint tables for interpretation of MICs and zone diameters [6].
 
 
 
 Four of 5 patients required valve replacement, with marked tissue destruction noted at the time of surgery. The mean time from admission to surgery was 15.3‚Äâ days (range:‚Äâ5-27‚Äâdays). Clinical teams reported where infection was advanced at the time of surgery, that the clinical course was more challenging, and recovery protracted. One patient died.
 
 
 
 In 2 patients, cutaneous lesions were observed at presentation. One had almost fully healed lesions on the hand, while another had a wrist abscess a month before presentation, from which _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Streptococcus dysgalactiae_ were isolated; however, the lesion was healing at the time of presentation. No other organisms were isolated from blood cultures or other specimens.
 
 
 
 There was no significant past medical history except in one patient who had chronic hepatitis C and a recent deep vein thrombosis.
 
 
 
 Discussion
 
 -----------
 
 This report describes the first documented cluster in England of non-toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ infections, presenting as infective endocarditis, in individuals who would not generally be considered high risk, as they had no cardiac risk factors, e.g., prosthetic heart valves, and were not recent intravenous drug users. Case series of infective endocarditis with non-toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ have been reported from New Zealand (10 cases between 1994 and 2007) and Australia (7 in a single year in 1993, including one death) [7,8]. More recently a case series was reported from South Africa describing 5 clinically severe infective endocarditis cases with a high case fatality (80%) and associated with a novel ST of non-toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ (ST885) [9]. While these cases were all reported in 2021 from the same area, no other epidemiological links were found. One individual reported polysubstance use, and only one had cardiac risk factors [9]. The severe clinical presentation and rapid progression of illness in the individuals described here are of concern, particularly in a population with poor access to healthcare, and where early diagnosis and prompt treatment are key to improved outcomes.
 
 
 
 A key consideration is the route of bacterial entry leading to invasive infection. It is hypothesised the nasopharyngeal mucosa is the primary point of entry for the organism. However, whether this reflects colonisation of the nasopharynx with a virulent strain(s) or the contamination of products is under investigation. Indeed, the absence of pharyngeal swabs prevented determination of colonisation of the pharynx. An individual case report, detailing a similar, rapidly progressive infective endocarditis in a cocaine user, suggested direct injury to the nasal mucosa as the likely point of entry of the causative organism leading to bacteraemia, within an airway colonised with non-toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ [10].
 
 
 
 Molecular typing of the isolates showed that most cases were infected with ST559 strains. However, historically sequencing efforts in the UK have focused on toxigenic isolates due to their association with severe clinical presentation. Given this bias, it is unclear whether the frequent detection of ST559 in these confirmed cases represents an epidemiological cluster or simply reflects ST559 as a commonly circulating strain in this population and further genomic analysis will be conducted. A study is planned to investigate the prevalence of non-toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ and the range of strain types circulating among people experiencing homelessness.
 
 
 
 The UKHSA has established a national investigation to coordinate the epidemiological and public health response. Enhanced surveillance for all non-toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ isolates from sterile culture has been implemented and prompt reporting of suspected cases to the UKHSA. An enhanced surveillance questionnaire has been developed for suspected cases to systematically assess risk factors, including detail on substance use, the products and equipment employed, frequency of use, and the impact of unstable housing conditions.
 
 
 
 Raising clinical awareness is a priority to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of cases and to support case-finding. Given the severity of cases in this cluster, clinicians have been reminded to consider early echocardiography in cases with _C. diphtheriae_ isolated from a sterile site, even in the absence of classical cardiac risk factors for infective endocarditis or a history of IVDU. Furthermore, it is imperative that all cases of infective endocarditis with non-toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ be discussed with regional endocarditis teams to facilitate early surgical intervention [11]. An alert has been published on the European surveillance portal for infectious diseases (Epipulse) along with direct communication with the World Health Organization to also raise awareness amongst international partners.
 
 
 
 Conclusions
 
 -----------
 
 This report raises awareness in medical and public health communities of the unusual and concerning emergence of severe infective endocarditis caused by a non-toxin-producing strain of _C. diphtheriae_, in patients who would not be considered at high clinical risk, but who had non-intravenous substance use and, in some cases, unstable housing. Given the need for surgical intervention and challenges of ensuring consistent follow-up, the presented cluster demonstrates a particularly concerning clinical and public health issue.

Whooping cough cases climb nationally, 2 infants die in Louisiana
--------------------------------------------------------------
In his 20 years working in pediatric infectious disease, Dr. John Schieffelin has never seen another illness like pertussis. Also known as whooping cough, it's a contagious respiratory illness that can develop into a painful, full-body cough. The coughing fits can be severe, often accompanied by a whooping sound when the person tries to catch their breath. And it's continuous, even if a person needs to be placed on a ventilator, says Schieffelin, an associate professor of pediatrics at Tulane University.

""For infants, it's really rather terrifying,"" he said. ""They're just coughing so much, they can't eat, they can't drink, and they often get a pneumonia, which means we have to put them on a ventilator. ... They just never stop coughing.""

In Louisiana, 2 infants have died of pertussis in the past 6 months, according to the state health department, the first deaths from the disease in the state since 2018. Louisiana has had 110 cases of pertussis reported so far in 2025, the health department said -- already approaching the 154 cases reported for all of 2024.

Cases are on the rise nationally too. There were more than 35 000 cases of whooping cough in 2024 in the USA, the highest number in more than a decade, and 10 people died -- 6 of them less than one year old. Experts say they see peaks and valleys with these kinds of illnesses over the years, but there have been about 6600 cases already in 2025, almost 4 times the number at this point in 2024.

""When you start to see these outbreaks ... it tends to be as a result of that increased circulation of the microbe in the community, as well as populations with no immunity or reduced immunity that are susceptible to the infection,"" said Dr. Lisa Morici, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Tulane University School of Medicine.

Concerned about increasing cases, experts are urging vaccination. The USA had more than 200 000 cases of whooping cough every year before the vaccine was introduced. By 1948, the vaccine was widely used, and infection rates began to drop. They started to rise again in the 1980s, largely due to increased surveillance and some waning vaccine immunity, but fell during the COVID-19 pandemic, when spread of many infectious diseases slowed due to measures like masking and distancing.

Children are recommended to get a dose of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis, or DTaP, vaccine at the ages of 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, between 15 to 18 months, and again between 4 to 6 years, according to the CDC. Adolescents should get a booster with a version of the vaccine called Tdap between age 11 and 12, and adults are urged to get Tdap boosters every 10 years.

Infants too young to be vaccinated are susceptible to the bacteria, which is why officials recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine in their third trimester, so the antibodies will be passed to the newborn. This prevents 78% of pertussis cases in young infants and is 91% effective against hospitalization, the CDC says. Another strategy that can protect infants is ""cocooning,"" in which members of the child's household all get vaccinated to ensure protection, Schieffelin said. Boosters are recommended because protection from the vaccine can fade over time, which may be one reason for the ongoing outbreaks. Declining vaccination rates are another reason. The percentage of American kindergartners who received the DTaP vaccine has steadily declined over the past 5 years, leaving thousands vulnerable to infection.

Organizers within the state say that although many people have become hesitant about vaccinations, another issue is a lack of access.

""Especially in a state like Louisiana, we've got a lot of poverty. We've got a lot of rural populations, and not everyone has access to regular medical care,"" said Dr. Jennifer Herricks, founder of Louisiana Families for Vaccines, a nonprofit that educates about vaccination. She says this is what makes state services and messaging even more important.

Pertussis cases in Louisiana are rising just weeks after the state Department of Health said it was ending vaccine promotion through events like health fairs.

""The State of Louisiana and LDH have historically promoted vaccines for vaccine-preventable illnesses through our parish health units, community health fairs, partnerships, and media campaigns,"" Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham wrote in a memo. ""While we encourage each patient to discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their provider, LDH will no longer promote mass vaccination.""

The memo differentiated between seasonal vaccines, such as COVID and flu vaccines, usually given at the state's mass vaccination clinics, and routine childhood vaccines, which it called ""an important part of providing immunity to our children."" But local officials still expressed concern about the message being sent to residents.

""When you cast aspersions or doubt about the safety and efficacy of one vaccine, I think it really has a ripple effect for all vaccines,"" said Dr. Jennifer Avegno, director of the New Orleans Health Department. Last week, Abraham shared vaccination guidelines on Facebook while acknowledging the pertussis deaths and increasing cases in the state. ""I've been encouraged that our state Department of Health is putting out good messaging about pertussis, but I worry that it's going to get sort of lost in the in the shuffle,"" Avegno said. ""It's maybe too little, too late.""

 Ernakulam [district in Kerala state] has seen more than 100 cases of hepatitis A in the last 3 weeks. Between 11 and 31 Mar 2025, the district recorded 110 cases. As of the latest data from the Department of Health shows, the total number of reported cases since 1 Feb 2025 has exceeded 320.
 
 
 
 Between 11 and 31 Mar 2025, the highest number of hepatitis A cases in Ernakulam occurred on 22 Mar 2025, with 22 cases. Other significant spikes were reported on 13 Mar 2025 (14 cases) and 29 Mar 2025 (12 cases), while 11 cases were recorded on 18 Mar 2025.
 
 
 
 Health authorities have linked the rise in cases to the consumption of contaminated water and food. On 22 Mar 2025, a cluster outbreak was reported in an apartment complex in Thrikkakara, which accounted for 22 of the cases. In response, remedial actions were taken in collaboration with the municipality's health department to curb the disease's spread.
 
 
 
 ""As part of control measures, we have asked local bodies across the district to ensure super-chlorination of water sources, especially wells used for supply of drinking water under various schemes of the Kerala Water Authority,"" they said. ""Apartment complexes have also been told to ensure that the water distributed in tankers remains safe for consumption,"" they said.
 
 
 
 Varghese Plassery, the chairperson of the Health standing committee of Thrikkakara municipality, said that super-chlorination of wells had been initiated across wards as part of efforts to check the spread of hepatitis A cases.
 
 
 
 Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers in association with health workers in the civic body were participating in the drive, he added.
 
 
 
 On the action initiated to prevent the use of contaminated food and water in eateries, he said directives had been issued to food outlets. ""We have also imposed fines up to INR 25 000 [USD 292] against those found operating in violation of food safety norms,"" he said.

 New York Times: Second child dies of measles in Texas
 
 -----------------------------------------------------
 
 An 8-year-old girl in Texas died Thursday morning [3 Apr 2025] of ""measles pulmonary failure,"" according to The New York Times, citing records it obtained.
 
 
 
 A Trump administration official told the paper the girl's cause of death is ""still being looked at."" This is the 2nd death in the state linked to the ongoing measles outbreak. The 1st death was in an unvaccinated school-age child in February 2025. A death in New Mexico remains under investigation.
 
 
 
 The outbreak -- now spanning Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and possibly Kansas -- reached at least 569 cases Friday [4 Apr 2025], according to data obtained from state health departments. Texas has reported 481 outbreak-associated cases; New Mexico has 54 cases, and Oklahoma reported 10 cases -- 8 confirmed and 2 probable - as of Friday [4 April 2025]. Cases in Kansas, which the state health department said may be linked to the outbreak, reached 24 as of Wednesday [2 Apr 2025].
 
 
 
 Experts said these numbers are most likely a severe undercount because many cases go unreported. Most of the reported cases are in people under 18, and experts worry about increasing hospitalizations, especially in younger children who are at higher risk of complications. ""The more children who get the disease means that there's an increased chance that there will be more children getting sicker with complications from measles,"" said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland.
 
 
 
 CNN did not immediately hear back from inquiries sent to the Texas Department of Health and the US Department of Health and Human Services. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr has downplayed the severity of the outbreak and faced criticism of the agency's response.

 Ontario reports 89 new measles cases, bringing provincial count to 661
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Ontario is reporting 89 new measles cases over the last week, bringing the province's case count to 661 since an outbreak began in the fall.
 
 
 
 That's compared to just over 100 new cases last week and 120 the week before. Public Health Ontario says there are 52 hospitalizations -- 10 more than last week -- including 3 in intensive care.
 
 
 
 Canada officially eliminated measles in 1998, but recent outbreaks of the highly contagious virus in places such as southwestern Ontario have public health officials urging people to get vaccinated. It also says measles cases still predominantly involve unvaccinated children in Ontario's southwestern public health unit, which accounts for almost 45% of the province's cases.
 
 
 
 Last week, Ontario's chief medical officer of health told The Canadian Press that the measles outbreak is likely to continue into the summer, but a stable rate of new cases is a hopeful sign that it will not worsen.
 
 
 
 Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. The World Health Organization says the virus can remain active in the air or on infected surfaces for up to 2 hours. It usually begins with a fever, cough, runny nose and red watery eyes, followed by a red blotchy rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body and limbs. The virus can lead to pneumonia, inflammation of the brain and death.

 <https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/indiana-first-reported-case-of-measles-in-2025>
 
 
 
 
 
 Indiana health officials announced Monday [7 Apr 2025] the state's first confirmed measles case of 2025: an unvaccinated minor in Allen County. This marks the state's first measles case since early 2024.
 
 
 
 The Allen County Health Department (ACHD) said the confirmation comes as part of an ongoing investigation in partnership with the Indiana Department of Health, but exposures to the confirmed case are minimal. The patient is stable and recovering, and no other information will be released to protect patient privacy, according to state news release.
 
 
 
 Measles outbreaks have risen in the last several months, with cases in Texas, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, California and Alaska. Cases have also been reported in Indiana's neighboring states of Kentucky and Ohio.
 
 
 
 Symptoms of measles typically appear 10 to 14 days after exposure, with a red, blotchy rash as the usual most visible symptom that appears 3 to 5 days after exposure. Other symptoms include high fever; sore throat; small white spots inside cheeks; red, watery eyes; a cough; and a runny nose.
 
 
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus spread through air droplets when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes. According to the ACHD, it can lead to serious health problems, especially in children younger than 5. Effects include ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, brain inflammation, severe hearing loss and in some cases death.
 
 
 
 Anyone experiencing symptoms should stay home and immediately contact a health provider. The health department offers vaccines for measles by appointment.

 There are now 2 cases of measles in Colorado this year [2025]. The second case is a 1-year-old in Denver who recently traveled.
 
 
 
 Health officials said Monday [7 Apr 2025] they confirmed the case in an unvaccinated Denver County infant resident. They recently traveled with family to an area of Chihuahua, Mexico, which is experiencing a measles outbreak. The news was announced in a joint press release from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment.
 
 
 
 Health officials urged Coloradans to check their vaccination status and monitor for symptoms like fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that usually starts several days after exposure on the face and spreads. People who were at the Denver Health emergency department on Sunday [6 Apr 2025] from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. may have been exposed, according to the release.
 
 
 
 The news comes after a case was reported at the end of March [2025], of a Pueblo adult who had traveled to an area of Mexico where there is an ongoing measles outbreak.
 
 
 
 ""Infants under 12 months are especially vulnerable to measles because they are typically too young to be vaccinated. This case is a stark reminder that families traveling internationally should delay unnecessary travel or talk to their health care providers about early MMR vaccination for infants, especially when visiting areas with known measles outbreaks,"" said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist and deputy chief medical officer at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.
 
 
 
 She expressed gratitude to Denver Health and the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment ""for their swift action, expertise, and collaboration in identifying this case and protecting the broader community.""
 
 
 
 Babies normally get the routine dose of measles, mumps, and rubella -- or MMR vaccine -- at 12 to 15 months. Measles is highly contagious and often severe, but it is a preventable disease. Health officials say the MMR vaccine remains the best protection. Colorado's vaccination rate for measles is 1 percentage point lower than needed to reach herd immunity, Herlihy said in a press conference when the first case was announced.
 
 
 
 ""What we call the community immunity or herd immunity threshold for measles is about 95%. So statewide we are falling short of that. So that does mean that Colorado is potentially at risk for outbreaks,"" said the state epidemiologist, Rachel Herlihy.

 The Mexican Association of Vaccinology warned that Mexico is already facing a measles outbreak, after confirming 126 cases of this viral disease, a figure that doubled in just 1 week, based on data from the Ministry of Health. Through its official X account (@vacunologia), the association highlighted that Chihuahua has 121 infections, making it the most affected state. Oaxaca follows with 4 cases and Sonora with 1.
 
 
 
 The Ministry of Health reported that during epidemiological week 13 -- which marks the close of the first quarter of the year -- 934 probable cases of measles and rubella have been reported. Of these, 252 remain under analysis, 556 have been ruled out, and no cases of rubella have been confirmed.
 
 
 
 One of the most alarming data is that 94.5% of the patients had not received the triple viral vaccine (MMR), which protects against measles, rubella, and mumps. Of the confirmed cases, only 5 had received one dose and only 2 had completed the full vaccination schedule.
 
 
 
 The group most affected by the outbreak is children between 5 and 9 years old, highlighting the urgency of strengthening immunization campaigns, especially in areas with the highest number of infections.

 The Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) has confirmed its first measles case this year [2025] in an unvaccinated child on Oahu under the age of 5. Gov. Josh Green made the announcement during a news conference this morning [8 Apr 2025], in which he urged everyone to get vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella.
 
 
 
 The case was confirmed Monday night [7 Apr 2025], Green said, in a child that recently returned from international travel. The child developed a fever, runny nose and cough shortly after returning to Hawaii, and sought medical care at Queen's Island Urgent Care Kapahulu after breaking out in a rash. DOH said the child is now recovering at home on Oahu, and a household member with similar symptoms is being evaluated for possible measles infection.
 
 
 
 ""I don't want anyone to panic,"" said Green. ""There is no reason to panic, and our Department of Health is on it. We've been talking through the morning and night about what we do. This is where good public health comes in. But we do have a kid with the measles.""
 
 
 
 DOH is investigating the case and working to identify and directly inform those who may have been exposed to the child. Flight notifications have been issued, and an alert has been sent to health care providers statewide.

 State health officials on Tuesday [8 Apr 2025] confirmed a case of measles in an adult living in Archuleta County -- the third reported in Colorado in 2025. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) announced that the person was contagious between March 26 and April 3 [2025]. They sought medical care on March 31 at a local clinic. Their vaccination status is currently unknown.
 
 
 
 ""This case does not appear to be linked to the other cases reported in Colorado, and the individual did not travel outside of Colorado, which leaves open the possibility of community transmission,"" said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist and deputy chief medical officer at CDPHE. Officials said there's no known connection between this case and previous ones confirmed in Pueblo and Denver counties.
 
 
 
 People who visited the following locations in Pagosa Springs during the times listed may have been exposed and are urged to monitor for symptoms for 21 days after their visit:
 
 - Wolf Creek Ski Area and Resort: March 28-30 (all day)
 
 - Pagosa Medical Group: March 31 (9:05 a.m. to 12:15 p.m.) and April 2 (3:45 to 6 p.m.)
 
 - City Market: March 31 (10 a.m. to 12:45 p.m.)
 
 
 
 ""Wolf Creek Ski Area was contacted earlier today [8 Apr 2025] by local public health officials about the case,"" a ski area spokesperson said in response to a 9NEWS request for comment. ""Wolf Creek Ski Area has provided the public health department with the pertinent information requested for the matter to be handled.""
 
 
 
 Health officials said people who are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated should avoid public gatherings and speak with their healthcare provider about receiving the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The vaccine is 97% effective after 2 doses, according to health officials.

 [3] Kansas: first hospitalization, more cases, more counties, Texas link
 
 Date: Wed 9 Apr 2025 12:21 CDT

 <https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/healthcare/2025/04/09/kansas-reports-first-measles-hospitalization-as-outbreak-grows/83009123007/>
 
 
 
 
 
 Kansas public health officials reported the first measles hospitalization amid a growing outbreak that is primarily affecting unvaccinated children. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) reported April 9 [2025] that Kansas is up to 32 measles cases statewide. That's up from 24 cases as of April 2 [2025]. There has been one hospitalization reported, but no deaths, from the Kansas measles outbreak.
 
 
 
 Genetic sequencing has found that the Kansas outbreak, which has grown to 2 additional counties in southwest Kansas, has a possible link to the larger outbreak in the Texas panhandle area. Nationwide, there were 607 confirmed measles cases across 22 jurisdictions as of April 3 [2025], according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Those cases have led to 74 hospitalizations and 3 deaths.
 
 
 
 ""KDHE, along with local health departments in the affected counties, are notifying individuals who may have been exposed,"" the state public health agency said in a March 28 [2025] health alert. ""Due to the highly contagious nature of measles, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area in Kansas and in surrounding counties, especially among those that are unvaccinated.""
 
 
 
 The cases have all been in southwest Kansas. Stevens County was the first with a confirmed case -- which was the first case of measles in Kansas in 7 years. Since then, cases were reported in Grant, Gray, Haskell, Kiowa and Morton counties. Now, the outbreak has grown to 2 additional counties: Ford and Finney, which are home to Dodge City and Garden City. Haskell County has had the most cases with 8, followed by Stevens County at 7 and Kiowa County at 6. All the rest have between 1 and 5, but KDHE has not reported the exact number in order to protect patient privacy.
 
 
 
 In Kansas, measles is primarily affecting unvaccinated children. Of the 32 cases, 6 are adults. Ten are ages infant to 4 years old -- which is when the second MMR vaccine does is recommended -- while 16 are in the 5-17 years old age range. At least 27 of the patients have not been vaccinated. Only one patient has received age-appropriate vaccinations, while one patient was under-vaccinated for their age. Vaccination status is pending verification for 2 patients, and one patient's vaccination status could not be verified.
 
 
 
 Kansas public health officials recommend MMR vaccine. In a health alert last month [March 2025], KDHE noted that Kansas is ""below the herd immunity threshold"" of at least a 95% vaccination rate. That rate, measured by estimated MMR immunization rates for Kansas kindergarten students during the 2023-24 school year, was 90.2% in 2023-24, down from 94.5% in 2019-20.

 The Yemeni governorates of Aden, Lahj, and Abyan are witnessing an alarming spread of measles, which has resulted in some fatalities among children. The total number of registered measles cases has amounted to 2500 cases with 8 deaths since the start of 2025; 85% of the cases were not previously vaccinated against measles.
 
 
 
 The local medical sources have expressed their fears of the delayed response from the health authorities to the evolving situation of the measles outbreak and called for urgent vaccination campaigns and to raise community awareness about the importance of children vaccination, noting that parental refusal is one of the main risk factors beside the weak public health system.

 Una guarder√≠a en un condado de Texas que es parte del brote de sarampi√≥n tiene m√∫ltiples casos, incluidos ni√±os demasiado peque√±os para estar completamente vacunados , dicen funcionarios de salud p√∫blica.
 
 
 
 El oeste de Texas se encuentra en medio de un brote de sarampi√≥n que sigue en aumento, con 481 casos el viernes. El estado ampli√≥ el n√∫mero de condados en la zona del brote esta semana a 10. El virus, altamente contagioso, comenz√≥ a propagarse a finales de enero y, seg√∫n las autoridades sanitarias, se ha propagado a Nuevo M√©xico, Oklahoma, Kansas y M√©xico.
 
 
 
 Tres personas no vacunadas han fallecido este a√±o por enfermedades relacionadas con el sarampi√≥n, entre ellas dos ni√±os de primaria en Texas. El segundo ni√±o falleci√≥ el jueves en un hospital de Lubbock, y el secretario de Salud, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., asisti√≥ al funeral en Seminole, el epicentro del brote.
 
 
 
 Hasta el viernes, hubo siete casos en una guarder√≠a donde un ni√±o peque√±o infectado se lo contagi√≥ a otros dos ni√±os antes de que se propagara a otras aulas, dijo la directora de Salud P√∫blica de Lubbock, Katherine Wells.
 
 
 
 Hay m√°s de 200 ni√±os en la guarder√≠a, dijo Wells, y la mayor√≠a ha recibido al menos una dosis de la vacuna contra el sarampi√≥n, las paperas y la rub√©ola, que se recomienda administrar por primera vez entre los 12 y los 15 meses de edad y una segunda dosis entre los 4 y los 6 a√±os. ‚ÄúTenemos algunos ni√±os que solo recibieron una dosis y ahora est√°n infectados‚Äù, dijo.
 
 
 
 El departamento de salud p√∫blica recomienda que cualquier ni√±o con solo una vacuna reciba su segunda dosis temprano y cambi√≥ su recomendaci√≥n para que los ni√±os en el condado de Lubbock reciban la primera dosis de la vacuna a los 6 meses de edad en lugar de 1. Un ni√±o que no est√° vacunado y asiste a la guarder√≠a debe quedarse en casa durante 21 d√≠as desde su √∫ltima exposici√≥n, dijo Wells.
 
 
 
 El n√∫mero de casos y hospitalizaciones en Texas ha aumentado de manera constante desde que comenz√≥ el brote y se dispar√≥ en 81 casos entre el 28 de marzo y el 4 de abril, con 16 personas m√°s hospitalizadas en ese per√≠odo.
 
 
 
 Los Centros para el Control y la Prevenci√≥n de Enfermedades de EE. UU. se reunieron el lunes con funcionarios de Texas para determinar cu√°ntas personas enviar√≠an al oeste de Texas para ayudar en la respuesta al brote, seg√∫n inform√≥ el portavoz Jason McDonald. McDonald esperaba la llegada de un peque√±o equipo a finales de esta semana, seguido de un grupo m√°s grande la pr√≥xima semana.
 
 
 
 Los CDC dijeron que su primer equipo estuvo en la regi√≥n desde principios de marzo hasta el 1 de abril, retirando el apoyo en el terreno d√≠as antes de que un segundo ni√±o muriera en el brote.

 Overview
 
 --------
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.
 
 
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 Reports
 
 -------
 
 The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles originating in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is so contagious, additional cases are likely to occur in Lea County and the surrounding communities. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays by noon Mountain Standard Time if there are new cases to report.
 
 
 
 Total cases: 56
 
 Vaccinated with at least one dose: 6
 
 Not vaccinated: 39
 
 Unknown: 11
 
 
 
 New Mexico Case Count by County (as of 8 Apr 2025)

 ---------------------------
 
 0-4 years: 13
 
 5-17 years: 16

 Pending: 0
 
 Total: 56
 
 
 
 Measles is primarily a disease of people who are not immunized and most residents in the outbreak area are protected from measles disease even if they are exposed to the virus. We expect to continue to identify new measles infections associated with this regional outbreak in New Mexico and Texas. This is not the explosive situation that we see with a pandemic where the population is unprotected. The measles cases that we have confirmed include persons with positive laboratory tests and persons who developed measles symptoms at the appropriate time following contact with a confirmed case. These cases were identified in the course of careful (epidemiologic) investigations. The newly added cases include people who were ill previously and were not identified until after their illness. The timing of rash onset for the current 56 cases shows them to be spread out over time and are not increasing dramatically:
 
 
 
 Week 1 (2/9-2/15): 14
 
 Week 2 (2/16-2/22): 6
 
 Week 3 (2/23-3/1): 8

 The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is reporting an outbreak of measles in the South Plains and Panhandle regions of Texas. At this time, 505 cases have been identified since late January 2025; 57 of the patients have been hospitalized.
 
 
 
 There have been 2 fatalities in school-aged children who lived in the outbreak area. The children were not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions. Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities.
 
 
 
 Based on the most recent data, DSHS has identified designated outbreak counties with ongoing measles transmission: Cochran, Dallam, Dawson, Gaines, Garza, Lynn, Lamar, Lubbock, Terry and Yoakum. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.

 Measles Prevention
 
 ------------------
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with 2 doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles. People who live in or visit the counties in the outbreak counties listed above should follow the outbreak vaccination recommendations.
 
 
 
 To get vaccinated, people can go to their health care provider or a pharmacy. Vaccines are also available through the Texas Vaccines for Children and Adult Safety Net Providers. Use the maps located on the measles outbreak page to locate a TVFC or ASN provider. Pharmacies can vaccinate people 14 and older without a prescription. Children under 14 need a prescription to get the MMR vaccine at a pharmacy.

 Taiwan reported 3 new measles cases last week [week of 30 Mar 2025], including 2 imported from Viet Nam and one domestic infection involving a man living in Taoyuan, with the source of his infection still under investigation, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Tuesday [8 Apr 2025].
 
 
 
 The domestic case involves a Taiwanese man in his 20s, who developed a fever and sore throat last Tuesday [1 Apr 2025] and was initially diagnosed with a common cold at a clinic, CDC physician Lin Yung-ching said at a regular news conference in Taipei.
 
 
 
 ""Two days later, a rash appeared on his face, so he went to the emergency room for treatment,"" Lin said, adding that he was diagnosed with measles on Monday [7 Apr 2025].
 
 
 
 CDC spokesman Lo Yi-chun said the Taoyuan man was not a direct contact of any previously confirmed case, but his housemate had been listed as a contact of an imported case from Viet Nam, as the housemate and the infected individual visited the same medical facility.
 
 
 
 The Taoyuan man was also present but did not enter the facility, Lo said, noting that his housemate has not shown any symptoms and had not been diagnosed with measles as of Tuesday [8 Apr 2025].
 
 
 
 Whether there was any overlap in movement between the Taoyuan man and the imported case, as well as the precise source of infection, remains under investigation, Lo added.
 
 
 
 Three household contacts of the Taoyuan man have been identified and are under health monitoring until 22 Apr 2025, while 128 individuals have been listed as contacts of the 2 imported cases, with their monitoring also set to continue until the same date [22 Apr 2025], he said.
 
 
 
 In the 2 imported cases -- a Taiwanese man in his 30s and a Vietnamese woman in her 20s -- they arrived in Taiwan from Viet Nam on 24 and 25 Mar 2025, respectively, according to CDC press materials.
 
 
 
 The woman developed a rash on 25 Mar 2025, while the man showed the same symptom last Thursday [3 Apr 2025]. They were confirmed to have measles last Tuesday [1 Apr 2025] and this Monday [7 Apr 2025], respectively, the CDC said.
 
 
 
 As of Monday [7 Apr 2025], Taiwan had recorded 22 confirmed measles cases since the start of 2025, including 8 domestic infections and 14 imported cases -- all from Viet Nam -- according to a CDC news release.
 
 
 
 Domestic and imported case numbers represent the highest in the same period for the past 6 years, the CDC added.

Un brote de varicela registrado en la Universidad Surcolombiana, sede Neiva, obligÃ³ a la instituciÃ³n a suspender las clases presenciales durante tres dÃ­as para un grupo de estudiantes de la Facultad de EducaciÃ³n. AsÃ­ lo anunciÃ³ el Instituto de Lenguas Extranjeras (ILEUSCO) mediante una circular informativa oficial, firmada por su coordinador.

â€œInformamos a todos los estudiantes y padres de familia o acudientes que los dÃ­as miÃ©rcoles 09, jueves 10 y viernes 11 de abril del presente aÃ±o, el ILEUSCO no desarrollarÃ¡ las clases de forma presencial como es habitual, debido a un brote de varicela presentado en la Facultad de EducaciÃ³nâ€, seÃ±ala el comunicado.

SegÃºn explicÃ³ la Universidad, las clases se desarrollarÃ¡n de manera virtual durante estos tres dÃ­as, utilizando los horarios y jornadas habituales, con el fin de garantizar la continuidad acadÃ©mica.

De acuerdo con el director de Bienestar Universitario, Ã‰dgar Cometa Guarnizo, se han confirmado al menos 10 casos de varicela en los programas de Licenciatura en Lenguas Extranjeras y Licenciatura en Literatura y Lengua Castellana, asÃ­ como un caso adicional en Derecho.

Siete de los casos corresponden a un mismo semestre del programa de InglÃ©s, mientras que otros dos pertenecen a una cohorte de Literatura y Lengua Castellana. La decisiÃ³n de trasladar temporalmente las clases a la virtualidad busca evitar la propagaciÃ³n del virus a otros grupos.

La instituciÃ³n informÃ³ que ya se encuentra en coordinaciÃ³n con la SecretarÃ­a de Salud Municipal, la cual recomendÃ³ informar a los estudiantes expuestos sobre la situaciÃ³n y tomar medidas para contener el brote.

â€œEnviamos una circular indicÃ¡ndoles a los jefes de programa que los estudiantes de las cohortes de ambos programas tuvieran clases remotasâ€, explicÃ³ Cometa. AdemÃ¡s, se mantiene una vigilancia activa sobre los estudiantes afectados y sus lugares de residencia, aunque no se ha detectado riesgo de propagaciÃ³n fuera del campus.

 The Institute of Tropical Medicine, Bach Mai Hospital has recorded the first adult measles death this year [2025]. [The patient] died of measles [with preexisting] chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes mellitus.
 
 
 
 According to information from Bach Mai Hospital, the patient was admitted with severe lung complications and required dialysis and ECMO. After 2 weeks of treatment, the patient passed away.
 
 
 
 According to statistics from the Ministry of Health, from the beginning of 2025 to the end of March 20 [2025], the country recorded 42 488 suspected measles cases in 63 provinces and cities; 5 deaths [were] related to measles. The majority of cases were in children from 9 months to under 15 years old (72.7%).
 
 
 
 Although measles is most common in children, adults with measles are still at risk of developing severe illness. According to information from the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Bach Mai Hospital, since the beginning of the year [2025], the hospital has received hundreds of measles cases in adults. Every day, the hospital receives 10-20 adult patients with measles with symptoms of fever, rash, cough, watery eyes, and runny nose.
 
 
 
 Many patients progressed severely with complications of pneumonia, respiratory failure, increased liver enzymes, diarrhea, and even encephalitis.
 
 
 
 Most of them have not been vaccinated, or have been vaccinated against measles but not given a booster shot. Measles cases are usually between 30 and 50 years old and subjectively do not think they have measles, so when they are hospitalized, the disease is already severe.
 
 
 
 Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that can easily spread to the community if not controlled. Therefore, when diagnosed with measles, the patient must be immediately isolated for treatment to avoid spreading the disease to other cases.
 
 
 
 Measles cases with complications such as upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, increased liver enzymes, liver failure, multiple organ failure requiring dialysis, [and] respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation account for about 5% of hospitalized patients.
 
 
 
 People with underlying diseases such as diabetes and immunodeficiency are at higher risk and can easily progress to severe disease requiring mechanical intervention.
 
 
 
 Regarding disease prevention, experts recommend that measles is an infectious disease and can be prevented by vaccination. The measles vaccine is included in the Expanded Immunization Program, given to children from 9 months, then given again when the child is 18 months old or 2 years old.
 
 
 
 For adults, when the immune system is reduced, a booster shot is also needed. If you have not been vaccinated or do not remember your vaccination history, you can get a booster shot with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.

 5 more measles cases confirmed in Allen County; Garrett school exposed
 
 ----------------------------------------------------
 
 The Allen County Department of Health on Wednesday [9 Apr 2025] announced that 5 additional cases of measles have been confirmed. This follows a single case the department confirmed on Monday [7 Apr 2025], bringing the overall total to 6.
 
 
 
 Garrett Keyser Butler Community Schools also posted to their Facebook page Wednesday that the Indiana Health Department notified the district they had been exposed to a case of measles. The post went on to say that the students and staff who were at the highest risk of exposure had been notified.
 
 
 
 According to a press release, the additional patients in Allen County are 3 unvaccinated minors and 2 adults with unknown vaccine status. All are recovering. No other identifying information about the patients will be released, due to state and federal privacy concerns. These confirmations -- as with the confirmation of the first case of measles in Allen County in 2025 -- come as part of an ongoing investigation being conducted with the Indiana Department of Health. All 6 Allen County cases are connected to each other, but at this time there are no known links to outbreaks in other states.
 
 
 
 The US has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024. Texas is reporting the majority of them with 505. The cases include 2 young elementary school-aged children who were not vaccinated and died from measles-related illnesses near the epicenter of the outbreak in rural Texas, which led Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to visit the community on Sunday [6 Apr 2025].

 Total of 14 cases confirmed in measles outbreak in Knox County
 
 ------------------------------------------------------
 
 A total of 14 cases of measles in Knox County are now confirmed, 7 of which are Ohio residents, the health department said Tuesday [8 Apr 2025].
 
 
 
 Last month [March 2025], 3 measles cases were confirmed in Knox County by the Ohio Department of Health and Knox County Public Health.
 
 
 
 ODH said the initial case in Knox County was from a visitor to the county who exposed others in Knox and nearby counties. The 2 additional cases were found in international travelers. The other 11 cases were linked to the initial case of measles, the county health department said.
 
 
 
 According to Knox County Public Health, the individuals with measles have isolated and their symptoms are being monitored. The county health department has been working with the individuals since contact tracing began and they have been in quarantine. No additional close contacts or suspected cases have been identified, Knox County Public Health said.
 
 
 
 ODH Director Bruce Vanderhoff also announced in March [2025] that there was a measles outbreak in Ashtabula County. ODH and Ashtabula County have identified 10 measles cases as of 1 Apr [2025]; 9 of the cases are linked to an adult man reported in the same month as the state's first measles case of the year.
 
 
 
 ""This disease can be very serious, even deadly, but it is almost entirely avoidable by being properly vaccinated. Measles is especially dangerous for young children, so I strongly urge all parents across Ohio to make sure your children are vaccinated. It is a crucial layer of protection that can save lives,"" Vanderhoff said.
 
 
 
 Medical professionals warn we may begin to see more cases of measles in the next few weeks, as this is typically the time it takes for the virus to manifest symptoms after exposure. Symptoms usually start to appear about 13 to 14 days following infection. If you return from vacation and start to feel unwell shortly thereafter, it's possible that you may have been exposed to the virus.

 --------------------------------------------
 
 Marking the fourth case to be confirmed in Michigan in 2025, the Mid-Michigan District Health Department announced Wed 9 Apr [2025] that a Montcalm County resident was diagnosed with measles. The department said the person had recently traveled out of state and they're working with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to determine points of exposure.
 
 
 
 The first case to be confirmed in Michigan was in March [2025] in Oakland County. Earlier this month [April 2025], 2 other cases were confirmed, with the second in Kent County and the third in Macomb County, just south of Mecosta County. In each of the 3 previous cases, the infected person had traveled outside of the US before returning to Michigan.
 
 
 
 District Health Department No. 10 recently reported that officials were on high alert amid outbreaks in the US and Canada.

 Nova Scotia Health warns of possible hepatitis A exposure in Bridgewater
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Nova Scotia Health has issued a warning after a case of hepatitis A was confirmed in the Bridgewater area. In a news release, the health authority advises people who ate or drank at Sushi Bay Japanese Cuisine on LaHave Street in Bridgewater between 8 and 28 Mar 2025 to monitor for symptoms of hepatitis A. Anyone who experiences symptoms over the next several weeks should contact their primary-care provider or call their local public health office. Anyone with severe symptoms should seek immediate care.
 
 
 
 Symptoms include:
 
 
 
 - Sudden onset of fever
 
 - Loss of appetite
 
 - Nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort
 
 - Within a few days to a week, darkening of the urine and yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice)
 
 
 
 Nova Scotia Health said the overall risk to the public is low, but there may have been individuals exposed to the virus. The health authority has been directly in touch with people who are at higher risk of getting the infection and will be offering them a vaccine that will help protect them from getting ill. There is no ongoing transmission of the virus at Sushi Bay, the authority said.
 
 
 
 ""The management of the location has been very cooperative and supportive, helping us to reach contacts and distribute information,"" the release said.
 
 
 
 While illness from hepatitis A usually lasts a week or 2, Nova Scotia Health said some cases can last several months. Most people recover without treatment, but in some cases hepatitis A can cause serious liver damage. It doesn't produce long-term infections. When someone is infected, they may have no symptoms.
 
 
 
 Nova Scotia Health said the most effective ways to reduce the risk of contracting hepatitis A include:
 
 - Washing hands thoroughly and often with soap and warm water, especially before preparing food or eating
 
 - Getting vaccinated if you are at a greater likelihood of exposure.

 The Institute of Tropical Medicine, Bach Mai Hospital has recorded the first adult measles death this year [2025]. [The patient] died of measles [with preexisting] chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes mellitus.
 
 
 
 According to information from Bach Mai Hospital, the patient was admitted with severe lung complications and required dialysis and ECMO. After 2 weeks of treatment, the patient passed away.
 
 
 
 According to statistics from the Ministry of Health, from the beginning of 2025 to the end of 20 Mar 2025, the country recorded 42 488 suspected measles cases in 63 provinces and cities; 5 deaths [were] related to measles. The majority of cases were in children from 9 months to under 15 years old (72.7%).
 
 
 
 Although measles is most common in children, adults with measles are still at risk of developing severe illness. According to information from the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Bach Mai Hospital, since the beginning of the year [2025], the hospital has received hundreds of measles cases in adults. Every day, the hospital receives 10-20 adult patients with measles with symptoms of fever, rash, cough, watery eyes, and runny nose.
 
 
 
 Many patients progressed severely with complications of pneumonia, respiratory failure, increased liver enzymes, diarrhea, and even encephalitis.
 
 
 
 Most of them have not been vaccinated, or have been vaccinated against measles but not given a booster shot. Measles cases are usually between 30 and 50 years old and subjectively do not think they have measles, so when they are hospitalized, the disease is already severe.
 
 
 
 Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that can easily spread to the community if not controlled. Therefore, when diagnosed with measles, the patient must be immediately isolated for treatment to avoid spreading the disease to other cases.
 
 
 
 Measles cases with complications such as upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, increased liver enzymes, liver failure, multiple organ failure requiring dialysis, [and] respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation account for about 5% of hospitalized patients.
 
 
 
 People with underlying diseases such as diabetes and immunodeficiency are at higher risk and can easily progress to severe disease requiring mechanical intervention.
 
 
 
 Regarding disease prevention, experts recommend that measles is an infectious disease and can be prevented by vaccination. The measles vaccine is included in the Expanded Immunization Program, given to children from 9 months, then given again when the child is 18 months old or 2 years old.
 
 
 
 For adults, when the immune system is reduced, a booster shot is also needed. If you have not been vaccinated or do not remember your vaccination history, you can get a booster shot with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.

 Overview
 
 --------
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.
 
 
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 Reports
 
 -------
 
 The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles originating in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is so contagious, additional cases are likely to occur in Lea County and the surrounding communities. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays by noon Mountain Standard Time if there are new cases to report.
 
 
 
 Total cases: 58
 
 Vaccinated with at least one dose: 6
 
 Not vaccinated: 41
 
 Unknown: 11
 
 
 
 New Mexico Case Count by County (as of 11 Apr 2025)

 County / Cases / Hospitalizations / Deaths
 
 Lea County / 55 / 4 / 1
 
 Eddy / 2 / 0 / 0

 ---------------------------
 
 0-4 years: 15
 
 5-17 years: 16
 
 18+ years: 27
 
 Pending: 0
 
 Total: 58
 
 
 
 Measles is primarily a disease of people who are not immunized and most residents in the outbreak area are protected from measles disease even if they are exposed to the virus. We expect to continue to identify new measles infections associated with this regional outbreak in New Mexico and Texas. This is not the explosive situation that we see with a pandemic where the population is unprotected. The measles cases that we have confirmed include persons with positive laboratory tests and persons who developed measles symptoms at the appropriate time following contact with a confirmed case. These cases were identified in the course of careful (epidemiologic) investigations. The newly added cases include people who were ill previously and were not identified until after their illness. The timing of rash onset for the current 58 cases shows them to be spread out over time and are not increasing dramatically:
 
 
 
 Week 1 (2/9-2/15): 14
 
 Week 2 (2/16-2/22): 6
 
 Week 3 (2/23-3/1): 8
 
 Week 4 (3/2-3/8): 6

 The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is reporting an outbreak of measles primarily in West Texas.
 
 
 
 - At this time, 541 cases have been confirmed since late January [2025]. This is an increase of 36 since the April 8 [2025] update.
 
 - 5%, or fewer than 30 of the confirmed cases, are estimated to be actively infectious since their rash onset date was more than a week before.
 
 - Individuals are infectious 4 days prior to and 4 days after rash onset.
 
 
 
 [A total of] 56 of the patients have been hospitalized. This number is the total number of people hospitalized over the course of the outbreak. It is not the current number of people in the hospital.
 
 
 
 There have been 2 fatalities in school-aged children who lived in the outbreak area. The children were not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.
 
 
 
 Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. Based on the most recent data, DSHS has identified designated outbreak counties with ongoing measles transmission: Cochran, Dallam, Dawson, Gaines, Garza, Lynn, Lamar, Lubbock, Terry and Yoakum.
 
 
 
 DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.

----------------------------------------------------------
Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is on the rise in Mexico and has raised concerns among health authorities. According to the most recent epidemiological notice issued by the Ministry of Health, as of week 14 of 2025, 696 confirmed cases and 37 deaths have been recorded due to this highly contagious respiratory disease. Of the 2549 probable cases reported in the country, confirmed infections are distributed across 25 states. The states with the highest number of cases are: Chihuahua (77), Mexico City (74), Aguascalientes (69), and Nuevo LeÃ³n (62).

In the last week, 78 new cases of whooping cough were reported, with the State of Mexico being the most affected with 15 cases, followed by Mexico City (9), Coahuila (8), Jalisco (8), Zacatecas (6), and Veracruz (5). The increase is considerable compared to previous years. As of 1 Mar 2025, 288 cases had been confirmed, compared to only 19 during the same period in 2024. During 2023, 188 cases were reported, while in 2024 the preliminary figure closed at 463.

The lack of surveillance between 2020 and 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decrease in whooping cough detection, but the current upswing demands greater attention.

 Number of measles cases in Hanoi continues to increase
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 
 The Hanoi Center for Disease Control (CDC) recorded 212 measles cases last week [week of 6 Apr 2025], bringing the total to more than 1600 cases since the beginning of the year [2025], while there were no cases in the same period last year [2024].
 
 
 
 Measles cases were recorded in 30 districts, towns, and cities, mainly in people who were not vaccinated or not fully vaccinated. Patients were distributed by age group, of which 12% were under 6 months old; 15% were 6-8 months old; 10% were 9-11 months old; 22% were 1-5 years old; 14% were 6-10 years old. The highest number was in the group of people over 10 years old, nearly 27%.
 
 
 
 Hanoi recorded 2 deaths from measles, a 4-year-old girl treated at the National Children's Hospital and a man treated at Bach Mai Hospital. Both suffered from complications due to underlying diseases.
 
 
 
 Hanoi CDC said that the number of measles cases has not shown a downward trend. It is forecasted that the number of cases will continue to increase and tend to increase in the group over 6 years old. The Ministry of Health also recorded that since the beginning of the year [2025], there have been more than 54 000 suspected measles cases in all localities. The reason for the measles outbreak is that the disease occurs in a 5-year epidemic cycle, and the vaccination progress is slower than the rate of disease spread.
 
 
 
 In response to the increase in measles cases, the Ministry of Health has stepped up vaccination for children aged 6 to under 9 months in 54 provinces and cities, instead of waiting until they are 9 months old as usual. Hanoi is continuing to review and organize measles vaccination for children who are subject to the campaign, focusing on children aged 6 to under 9 months and children aged 1-10 who have not received 2 doses of measles vaccine.
 
 
 
 On 13 Apr [2025], the Department of Preventive Medicine (Ministry of Health) recommended measles prevention for high-risk groups in the context of many cases recorded in adults, with severe progression and death. The Ministry of Health noted that measles is the fastest-spreading infectious disease, and everyone is at risk of contracting the disease. The disease can cause dangerous complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, otitis media, corneal ulcers or diarrhea, and even death.
 
 
 
 Therefore, the Ministry of Health recommends that people at high risk (people with chronic lung disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, people over 50 years old), especially those with unknown vaccination history and have never had measles, should proactively get vaccinated against measles. People at high risk when experiencing symptoms of measles such as fever, cough, runny nose, and rash need to go to medical facilities immediately for examination, timely treatment advice, and to limit serious complications of the disease.
 
 
 
 At the same time, limit contact with cases of measles or suspected measles. If contact is necessary, wear a mask and wash your hands after contact with the patient. Increase personal hygiene, nose and throat, keep warm, improve physical condition to increase resistance to disease.

 The World Health Organization [WHO] said that a total of 36 wild poliovirus (WPV1) cases has been reported -- 3 from Afghanistan and 33 from Pakistan -- which indicates 4-fold and 12-fold increase in the number of WPV1 in the countries, respectively.
 
 
 
 The WHO statement from the forty-first meeting of the Polio IHR Emergency Committee said that the cases have brought the number of WPV1 to 99 in 2024 and 3 in 2025 so far.
 
 
 
 ""A total of 741 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in 2024, 113 from Afghanistan and 628 from Pakistan. In 2025, 80 WPV1-positive environmental samples have been reported, 9 from Afghanistan and 71 from Pakistan,"" reads part of the statement.
 
 
 
 The statement also reads that in Afghanistan, the southern region has witnessed an increase in WPV1 detections, both in environmental samples and cases during 2024, while Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Balochistan were impacted the most by the virus.
 
 
 
 The WHO has also expressed concerns over the continuation of the absence of house-to-house vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan, adding that this represents the risk of further WPV1 spread.
 
 
 
 The world health body has warned of cross-border WPV1 transmission as more people move between Afghanistan and Pakistan and Afghan refugees return to Afghanistan from Pakistan.
 
 
 
 The Ministry of Public Health of the Islamic Emirate has not commented on the new numbers by the WHO so far.

 2 cases of measles confirmed on Prince Edward Island, involving adults who traveled within Canada
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Health officials in Prince Edward Island have confirmed 2 cases of measles, the province's first reported cases since 2013. In a news release, PEI's Chief Public Health Office said the 2 adults who tested positive had traveled together to an area in Canada where outbreaks continue. Neither had been immunized against the virus, and both have since recovered, the CPHO said.
 
 
 
 Public health nursing is providing contacts of the 2 people with vaccinations as needed, and contact-tracing is underway. No public exposures have been identified at this time. Anyone who is not vaccinated and is considered a close contact of someone with measles will need to isolate for 21 days.
 
 
 
 Dr. Heather Morrison, the province's chief public health officer, told CBC News that Islanders should check their vaccination records and get immunized if they aren't up to date.
 
 
 
 ""It's not unexpected that we're getting a couple of cases of measles. We're going to work really hard to try to make sure that any spread is very limited,"" Morrison said. ""It's a really good reminder for Islanders about the importance of measles-containing vaccine.... It's too bad to see so many cases in the country and outbreaks occurring in other places, and we want to limit the impact that has here.""
 
 
 
 The CPHO's current recommendations for vaccination:
 
 
 
 - Adults born before 1970 are considered to have acquired natural immunity and do not require the vaccine. Anyone travelling outside of Canada should receive one dose of measles vaccine.
 
 
 
 - Adults born in or after 1970 who have not had measles, nor received 2 doses of vaccine, should receive 2 doses.
 
 - Regardless of age, students entering post-secondary education, health-care workers, and military personnel should receive 2 doses if they have no evidence of having had measles and no documentation of having received 2 doses of the vaccine.
 
 
 
 Anyone living in PEI who is not up to date with the measles vaccines is eligible to receive it free of charge. Islanders should call the nearest public health nursing office and speak with a nurse to find out if vaccinations are up to date. Those experiencing symptoms of measles should call 811 or contact their primary care provider before visiting any health-care facility for treatment, to prevent spreading the virus to others.
 
 
 
 New Brunswick experienced a measles outbreak of 50 cases starting in November 2024, but officials said in January [2025] that it had been declared over. There are no current cases of measles in Nova Scotia, and only one case has been confirmed in the past 5 years. Officials there are watching the situation in other provinces and countries closely, and taking steps to ensure people have the opportunity to get vaccinated if eligible, and know the risks before travelling.

Doctors in the UAE are urging parents to ensure their children are vaccinated against chickenpox. This advisory follows health notices issued by a few schools after some reported cases of chickenpox. Institutions have also observed instances of scarlet fever, a bacterial infection, among students.

Medics explained that chickenpox, a contagious viral infection, tends to see increased activity during the warmer months. A pediatric consultant at Saudi German Hospital Dubai, said the increase in chickenpox cases is noticeable in school environments. â€œThere has indeed been an increase in reported chickenpox (varicella) cases among children, particularly within school environments,â€ he said.

He linked the trend to missed immunisations during the pandemic. â€œDuring the pandemic, many routine childhood vaccinations were delayed or missed. Some parents may also have postponed non-essential clinic visits. This has left a cohort of children either unvaccinated or partially immunised, increasing susceptibility.â€

Echoing the concern another specialist pediatrician at Medcare Hospital Sharjah, noted a change in how the disease is presenting in some children.

â€œThere has definitely been an increase in chickenpox cases recently, particularly among school-aged children. Weâ€™re seeing more intense symptoms than usual in some cases -- higher fevers, more widespread and inflamed rashes, and increased skin infections due to scratching,â€ he said. â€œIn rare cases, children develop complications like pneumonia or neurological symptoms, especially if they have a weakened immune system.â€

 2025 Measles Outbreak Guidance
 
 ------------------------------
 
 Overview
 
 --------
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.
 
 
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 Reports
 
 -------
 
 The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles originating in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is highly contagious, additional cases are likely to occur.
 
 We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays by noon Mountain Standard Time if there are new cases to report.
 
 
 
 Total Cases 63
 
 Vaccinated with at least one dose 6
 
 Not Vaccinated 46
 
 Unknown 11
 
 
 
 New Mexico Case Count by County (as of 15 Apr 2025):
 
 
 
 County / Cases / Hospitalizations / Deaths
 
 Lea County / 59 / 5 / 1
 
 Eddy / 2 / 0 / 0
 
 Chaves / 1 / 0 / 0

 Age Ranges of Measles Cases:
 
 0-4 Years 17
 
 5-17 Years 19 
 
 18+ Years 27 
 
 Pending 0
 
 Total 63
 
 
 
 Measles is primarily a disease of people who are not immunized and most residents in the outbreak area are protected from measles disease even if they are exposed to the virus. We expect to continue to identify new measles infections associated with this regional outbreak in New Mexico and Texas. This is not the explosive situation that we see with a pandemic where the population is unprotected. The measles cases that we have confirmed include persons with positive laboratory tests and persons who developed measles symptoms at the appropriate time following contact with a confirmed case. These cases were identified in the course of careful (epidemiologic) investigations. The newly added cases include people who were ill previously and were not identified until after their illness. The timing of rash onset for the current 63 cases shows them to be spread out over time and are not increasing dramatically:
 
 
 
 Week 1 (9-15 Feb): 14
 
 Week 2 (16-22 Feb): 6
 
 Week 3 (23 Feb-1 Mar): 8
 
 Week 4 (2-8 Mar): 6
 
 Week 5 (9-15 Mar): 6
 
 Week 6 (16-22 Mar): 3

 Measles Outbreak - 15 Apr 2025
 
 ------------------------------
 
 The Texas Department of State Health Services is reporting an outbreak of measles primarily in West Texas. At this time, 561 cases have been confirmed since late January 2025. This is an increase of 20 since the 11 Apr 2025 update. Four percent, or fewer than 25 of the confirmed cases, are estimated to be actively infectious since their rash onset date was more than a week before. Individuals are infectious 4 days prior to and 4 days after rash onset. Fifty-eight of the patients have been hospitalized. This number is the total number of people hospitalized over the course of the outbreak. It is not the current number of people in the hospital.
 
 
 
 There have been 2 fatalities in school-aged children who lived in the outbreak area. The children were not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions. Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. Based on the most recent data, DSHS has identified designated outbreak counties with ongoing measles transmission: Cochran, Dallam, Dawson, Gaines, Garza, Lynn, Lamar, Lubbock, Terry and Yoakum. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.

El aumento de los casos de tos ferina, una enfermedad altamente contagiosa, ha encendido las alarmas en la capital colombiana.

El secretario de Salud de BogotÃ¡, Gerson Bermont afirmÃ³ que en lo que va de 2025, se han registrado 107 contagios de esta enfermedad, lo que representa un incremento drÃ¡stico en comparaciÃ³n con los once reportados durante todo 2024. El sistema de vigilancia epidemiolÃ³gica tambiÃ©n ha identificado 390 casos probables, cuatro veces mÃ¡s que el mismo periodo del aÃ±o anterior.

SegÃºn datos presentados por la SecretarÃ­a de Salud de BogotÃ¡, la mayor incidencia se encuentra en menores de cinco aÃ±os, para quienes el riesgo de complicaciones severas es mayor. Diana Walteros, subdirectora de Vigilancia en Salud PÃºblica de la entidad, explicÃ³ a Blu Radio que esta enfermedad puede ser grave en niÃ±os de un aÃ±o, sobre todo en menores de seis meses. Se presenta con accesos de tos, dificultad para respirar, el niÃ±o se puede poner morado, e instÃ³ a los padres a buscar atenciÃ³n mÃ©dica inmediata ante cualquier sÃ­ntoma sospechoso.

El impacto de la tos ferina se ha distribuido de manera desigual en la capital. SegÃºn reportes de la SecretarÃ­a de Salud, las localidades de San CristÃ³bal y Ciudad BolÃ­var encabezan la lista de casos confirmados, con 19 y 17 respectivamente, seguidas de Usme y Kennedy, que han registrado nueve cada una.

El anÃ¡lisis tambiÃ©n detalla los grupos de edad mÃ¡s afectados: 70 casos corresponden a niÃ±os menores de cinco aÃ±os, 12 a menores entre los 5 y 14 aÃ±os, mientras que 18 contagios se han presentado en adultos. Walteros destacÃ³ al medio que, aunque los niÃ±os son la poblaciÃ³n mÃ¡s vulnerable, los adolescentes y adultos pueden actuar como transmisores silenciosos, por lo que las medidas de prevenciÃ³n deben abarcar a todas las edades.

En respuesta al aumento de contagios, la SecretarÃ­a de Salud de BogotÃ¡ ha intensificado sus estrategias de vacunaciÃ³n, ofreciendo este servicio de forma gratuita en mÃ¡s de 200 puntos de la ciudad. TambiÃ©n se han reforzado las campaÃ±as de educaciÃ³n sobre medidas preventivas, como el uso de mascarilla en personas con sÃ­ntomas respiratorios y el lavado constante de manos. Las autoridades recomiendan ademÃ¡s que las mujeres embarazadas reciban la dosis correspondiente para proteger a los reciÃ©n nacidos durante sus primeros meses de vida.

Las vacunas vacunas son gratuitas y estÃ¡n incluidas en el Programa Ampliado de Inmunizaciones (PAI), indicÃ³ la SecretarÃ­a Distrital de Salud de BogotÃ¡ - crÃ©dito SecretarÃ­a Distrital de Salud
 
Mientras tanto, en MedellÃ­n, la situaciÃ³n es diferente. La SecretarÃ­a de Salud de esta ciudad confirmÃ³ que hasta el momento solo se han registrado seis casos de tosferina en 2025, sin evidencias de un brote. Sin embargo, un significativo aumento en las infecciones respiratorias agudas (IRA) mantiene en alerta a las autoridades locales. En lo corrido del aÃ±o, se han registrado mÃ¡s de 138.600 consultas ambulatorias por IRA, lo que representa un incremento del 10 % frente al mismo periodo del aÃ±o anterior.

Rita Elena Almanza, lÃ­der de EpidemiologÃ­a en MedellÃ­n, compartiÃ³ la preocupaciÃ³n sobre el impacto de estas infecciones: â€œPodrÃ­amos decir que sÃ­ tenemos un pico respiratorio. Es importante llamar la atenciÃ³n porque esas cerca de 600 hospitalizaciones semanales corresponden, en su mayorÃ­a, un 80 %, a adultos mayores de 70 aÃ±os, pero tambiÃ©n a niÃ±os pequeÃ±osâ€ afirmÃ³ a Caracol Radio.

En cuanto a las acciones preventivas, en MedellÃ­n se ha priorizado la vacunaciÃ³n contra la influenza, especialmente para grupos de riesgo como niÃ±as y niÃ±os de 6 a 23 meses, mujeres embarazadas, adultos mayores y personas con comorbilidades.

 After 34 years, measles cases are confirmed in Belize
 
 ------------------------------------------------
 
 Belize has confirmed cases of measles for the first time in 34 years. The Ministry of Health and Wellness announced in a virtual press conference that the first suspected cases appeared after Belizeans visited Mexico in March [2025]. Two people returned with symptoms like fever and skin rashes, and tests confirmed they had measles. This breaks Belize's record of being measles-free since 1991. The patients are from the Corozal and Cayo districts and were part of a group that recently came back from Mexico. The rest of the group is now in isolation, being monitored for any signs of fever or rash. The ministry is urging the public to get vaccinated against measles, which can take takes about 21 days to recover from. News Five's Marion Ali reports.
 
 
 
 After more than 30 years without measles, Belize confirmed 2 cases of the virus on Saturday [12 Apr 2025]. Dr. Melissa Diaz-Musa, director of Public Health and Wellness, said the group, from 4 different communities in Belize, traveled to Chihuahua, Mexico, in January [2025] and returned on 30 Mar [2025]. The rest of the group is in isolation and showing no symptoms so far, with most of them being vaccinated. The patients are teenagers.
 
 
 
 Dr. Melissa Diaz-Musa, director, Public Health & Wellness:
 
 
 
 ""The details of the 2 positive cases are as follows: a 17-year-old male, unvaccinated, who started with fever, rash, and cough on 3 Apr [2025]. Laboratory confirmation of measles was received on 12 Apr [2025]. The second case is a 17-year-old female, unvaccinated, who started with symptoms on 2 Apr [2025]. Laboratory confirmation of measles was received on 12 Apr [2025]. All 15 travelers have been interviewed by the staff of the Ministry of Health and Wellness and are being monitored regularly for signs and symptoms.""
 
 
 
 Musa explained that they acted as soon as they got reports of patients with symptoms, while waiting for test results to confirm measles. These cases come amid a surge in measles across the Americas, with [many hundreds of] confirmed cases in Canada, the USA, Mexico, and Argentina. Although many people in Belize are vaccinated, the rate is still below the 95 percent target, especially in the Cayo and Belize districts. The Ministry of Health is urging Belizeans to get vaccinated.
 
 
 
 Dr. Melissa Diaz-Musa:
 
 
 
 ""The Ministry of Health and Wellness urges the public to ensure vaccinations are up to date, particularly for children. Parents, check your children's vaccine cards to determine if their vaccines are up to date. Adults who have not received an MMR vaccine or who are uncertain of their vaccination status should visit a health facility to receive the vaccine.""
 
 
 
 Dr. Natalia Beer, technical advisor, Maternal and Child Health, Ministry of Health:
 
 
 
 ""Any unvaccinated person traveling abroad who comes in contact with persons that may be infected with measles, more than likely will be infected with measles. We have so many flights in and out of Belize, and if we look at the data in the USA, a lot of destinations from Belize, they're having outbreaks.""
 
 
 
 Dr. Natalia Beer, the ministry's technical advisor for Maternal and Child Health, urged everyone, especially those in certain age groups or with existing health conditions, to get vaccinated, particularly if they plan to travel outside Belize in the next month. What makes this illness highly contagious is that patients can spread it even before they show any symptoms.
 
 
 
 Dr. Natalia Beer:
 
 
 
 ""The person is contagious even before having signs and symptoms, so it makes it more difficult for one to say, I will stay away from persons that are ill with fever and rash. But the contagious period starts even before that. The high-risk group that we need to target now is unvaccinated children and teenagers, unvaccinated adults from 20 to 59 years, adults greater than 60 years, unvaccinated healthcare workers, immune-compromised persons, pregnant women, and populations living in communities with low vaccination coverage.""
 
 
 
 Measles usually starts with symptoms like fever, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that begins at the hairline and spreads down the chest, back, limbs, and the rest of the body. The illness typically lasts for about 21 days from the onset of symptoms. The ministry has started holding monthly mobile clinics in remote communities to give out vaccinations, but they've noticed that people are hesitant to get vaccinated. This hesitancy has increased since the COVID outbreak.

Alert due to dramatic increase in whooping cough cases in BogotÃ¡
------------------------------------------------------------
The increase in cases of whooping cough, a highly contagious disease, has set off alarm bells in the Colombian capital. BogotÃ¡'s Secretary of Health, Gerson Bermont, stated that so far in 2025, 107 cases of this disease have been recorded, which represents a drastic increase compared to the 11 reported during all of 2024. The epidemiological surveillance system has also identified 390 probable cases, 4 times more than the same period in 2024.

According to data presented by the BogotÃ¡ Ministry of Health, the highest incidence is in children under 5 years of age, for whom the risk of severe complications is greater. Diana Walteros, deputy director of Public Health Surveillance for the entity, explained to Blu Radio that this disease can be serious in children under 1 year of age, especially those under 6 months old. It presents with coughing fits and difficulty breathing, and the child may turn purple. She urged parents to seek immediate medical attention if any suspicious symptoms appear.

The impact of whooping cough has been unevenly distributed in the capital. According to reports from the Ministry of Health, the towns of San CristÃ³bal and Ciudad BolÃ­var lead the list of confirmed cases, with 19 and 17, respectively, followed by Usme and Kennedy, which have registered 9 each.

The analysis also details the most affected age groups: 70 cases correspond to children under 5, 12 to children between 5 and 14 years old, while 18 infections have occurred in adults. Walteros emphasized to the media that, although children are the most vulnerable population, adolescents and adults can act as silent transmitters, so preventive measures must cover all ages.

In response to the increase in infections, the BogotÃ¡ Health Secretariat has intensified its vaccination strategies, offering this service free of charge at more than 200 locations throughout the city. Educational campaigns on preventive measures, such as the use of masks by people with respiratory symptoms and constant handwashing, have also been strengthened. Authorities also recommend that pregnant women receive the corresponding dose to protect newborns during their first months of life.

Meanwhile, in MedellÃ­n, the situation is different. The city's Ministry of Health confirmed that only 6 cases of whooping cough have been recorded so far in 2025, with no evidence of an outbreak. However, a significant increase in acute respiratory infections (ARI) has local authorities on alert. So far in 2025, more than 138 600 outpatient consultations for ARI have been recorded, representing a 10% increase compared to the same period in 2025.

Rita Elena Almanza, head of Epidemiology in MedellÃ­n, shared her concern about the impact of these infections: ""We could say that we do have a respiratory peak. It's important to draw attention to it because those nearly 600 weekly hospitalizations correspond, for the most part, 80%, to adults over 70 years of age, but also to young children,"" she told Caracol Radio.

Regarding preventive measures, influenza vaccination has been prioritized in MedellÃ­n, especially for at-risk groups such as children aged 6 to 23 months, pregnant women, older adults, and people with comorbidities.

 The state Department of Health (DOH) confirmed a second measles case on Oahu in a household member of an unvaccinated child who contracted the virus while traveling internationally. The adult member of the family, who also traveled abroad, was showing signs of measles and was presumed to have measles. Test results came back on Wednesday [16 Apr 2025], confirming a measles infection. Because of the duration between symptom onset and test specimen collection, DOH performed an antibody test, which takes longer to process.
 
 
 
 The adult is no longer contagious, and the child has fully recovered, according to DOH. Officials said no new suspected measles cases have been reported.
 
 
 
 DOH previously conducted contact tracing efforts and said it identified all the people who were exposed in public settings except those at the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport. The state agency said it is continuing its response by reaching out to anyone who may have been exposed.
 
 
 
 Measles is one of the world's most contagious viruses, and it is spread through direct contact with an infected person or through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. An infected person can spread measles up to 4 days after developing the rash and 4 days afterwards. The virus can remain in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person has left the room.

 [The cases were in international travelers and were unimmunized. A case or so of recognized measles in travelers does not, however, necessarily set off an autochthonous outbreak. With measles, having a well-immunized population will prevent this, along with rapid recognition of the index case for isolation and contact identification purposes. It is the same with gastrointestinal diseases such as cholera, but instead of immunization, we are protected by an adequate sewage system. Public health has protected us in many ways. - Mod.LL]

 Montana's Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) and the Gallatin City-County Health Department (GCCHD) have confirmed 5 cases of measles in Gallatin County. According to a DPHHS press release, they are Montana's first cases of measles since 1990 and are in children and adults who were exposed to measles while traveling outside of Montana. The individuals reside in Gallatin County and are isolating at home.
 
 
 
 The release says all 5 individuals are unvaccinated, or their vaccine status is unknown. GCCHD is assessing any potential exposures and contacting those who may have been exposed. GCCHD has listed potential points of exposure on its website and will continue to update the list as needed or more information becomes available.
 
 
 
 According to the release, measles, a highly infectious airborne disease, can spread before people know they have it and before any rash appears. Those without prior infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting measles if exposed.
 
 
 
 If you are unsure of your vaccination status, health officials recommend these steps:
 
 - Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.
 
 - Contact your doctor's office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.
 
 - Reach out to the health department where you grew up.
 
 - Check your home state immunization registries.
 
 
 
 The release says measles typically begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth, and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. Health officials recommend vaccination as the best way to protect against measles. Anyone seeking vaccination is urged to call your primary care physician as soon as possible, or schedule an appointment with GCCHD for the MMR vaccine by calling 406-582-3100.

 Michigan now has a measles outbreak in Montcalm County, the Mid-Michigan District Health Department told the Detroit Free Press. Brady Guilbault, the department's public information officer, confirmed April 17 [2025] that 2 additional measles cases have been identified that are tied to an infection initially reported April 9 in a Montcalm County resident who traveled out of state. The department issued an alert to local health care providers, but had not made public notification of the outbreak as of early Thursday afternoon [17 Apr 2025].
 
 
 
 More than an hour after the Free Press reported the outbreak, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, in conjunction with the Mid-Michigan District Health Department, issued a news release publicly announcing it. The outbreak in Montcalm County is tied to a large, ongoing outbreak in Ontario, Canada, and there are no new public exposure sites to report in Michigan tied to the cases, according to the news release.
 
 
 
 Guilbault said in an email message that there are no known public exposures when people with measles in Montcalm County were contagious and may have infected others.
 
 
 
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines an outbreak as 3 or more measles cases that are epidemiologically linked. The health department, which includes Montcalm, Clinton and Gratiot counties in mid-Michigan, advised medical providers in an April 16 [2025] email alert to consider measles infection in any patient who reports having a fever and rash, especially if the person has traveled in the last 21 days, is unvaccinated or the person's vaccination status is unknown.

All of the 19 cases are linked to 2 people who visited the unnamed location from out of state, according to Tefteller, and no known cases originated with any Upshur County resident.
 
 
 
 All affected patients are isolated from the public and are in quarantine at this same location, and are in daily contact with DSHS and are following all the appropriate guidelines, he added. Tefteller said that none of the cases are critical or have required hospitalization. All cases are adults over the age of 18. There are no reports of measles in any Upshur County public schools, public buildings, county operations, or medical facilities, the judge confirmed.
 
 
 
 Tefteller ended by sharing the following information regarding prevention of measles: The best way to prevent measles is to be vaccinated with 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine. This is primarily administered as the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, and 2 doses prevent more than 97% of measles infections.

 Since the beginning of March 2025, measles cases have been increasingly detected. Five children died in Zanjibar and Khanfer districts of Abyan governorate, while in Al Dali governorate, a rapid rise of measles cases in children was noticed among severe shortages of medical supplies. The health authorities in the above 2 governorates attributed the sudden surge of measles to the parental refusal of vaccination combined with the low vaccination coverage.

 Historical measles cases
 
 ------------------------
 
 Measles has been eliminated in Canada since 1998, and therefore endemic transmission no longer takes place in the country. However, cases continue to occur sporadically, usually due to importation from regions where measles is circulating. Some imported cases result in time-limited outbreaks. From 1998 to 2024, there were an average of 91 measles cases reported in Canada annually, with between 0 and 752 cases reported each year.

 Case of measles found in Tel Aviv area as virus resurges globally
 
 ---------------------------------------------------
 
 The Health Ministry warned Monday [21 Apr 2025] that a person has been diagnosed with the measles in the Tel Aviv area, as the virus -- which was once considered near-eradicated in many Western countries -- has been making a comeback.
 
 
 
 According to the ministry, the person in question arrived on an overnight El Al flight Friday [18 Apr 2025] morning from London, then took the train to the Tel Aviv University stop and a bus to nearby Tagore Street. On Saturday [19 Apr 2025] they spent time at an escape room in Petah Tikva and a restaurant in Herzliya. The ministry warned anyone who may have come in contact with the individual to ensure that they are fully vaccinated for measles.
 
 
 
 While measles cases in Israel are rare, the disease has not been considered eliminated in the country, and there have been multiple recorded deaths related to the virus in recent years. An 18-month-old toddler died of measles in Jerusalem in 2018 during a spike in cases. The girl, who had not been vaccinated, was Israel's first recorded measles fatality in 15 years. The outbreak in 2018 and 2019 infected over 4000 people, most of whom were unvaccinated.
 
 
 
 The Health Ministry said at the time that full vaccination was 97% effective at preventing the disease, and that measles could leave lasting damage and was fatal for one out of every 1000 infected children.
 
 
 
 In 2019, a 43-year-old Israeli flight attendant died of complications related to the disease after contracting measles on a flight. Blood tests showed she had been vaccinated with one dose, but not a second recommended inoculation.
 
 
 
 Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that's airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes, or coughs. It manifests itself in fever, general malaise, runny nose, and rash, and can have serious and even life-threatening complications, said the Health Ministry in a Monday [21 Apr 2025] statement. Anyone who suspects they have contracted measles or is suffering from these symptoms should alert the clinic or emergency room before arrival. They should also avoid being in public spaces like shopping malls, buses, and trains.
 
 
 
 It is preventable through vaccines, and the Health Ministry recommends all citizens check their immunization status to see if they are protected from the disease.

 Louisiana Department of Health confirms Greater New Orleans area measles case
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 The Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) has confirmed a case of measles in an adult resident of Region 1 (comprised of Jefferson, Orleans, Plaquemines, and St. Bernard parishes). At this time, the patient's exposure to measles appears to be linked to international travel. The individual who tested positive is in isolation and has received treatment at a Region 1 hospital. The patient was not hospitalized and will remain in isolation until no longer infectious. This patient was not vaccinated. To protect patient confidentiality, no further information about the patient will be released.
 
 
 
 The LDH Office of Public Health is working to identify and notify those who have come into contact with the infected individual. This is the first measles case reported in Louisiana in 2025. In 2024, 3 confirmed travel-associated measles cases were reported in Louisiana, all in the greater New Orleans area.
 
 
 
 Measles is highly contagious and can spread rapidly among individuals who have not received the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. Measles cases can result in hospitalization and, in extreme cases, can lead to death. The measles virus can be particularly dangerous for babies and young children. The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether the MMR vaccine is right for you.
 
 
 
 The Department's epidemiology investigation is ongoing. LDH will conduct media interviews when more information is available.

 [2] Virginia (northwest region): international traveler

 Virginia reports first 2025 measles case, exposures sites in Woodbridge and Fredericksburg
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 
 The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) has confirmed the state's first measles case of 2025, involving a child aged 0-4 in the Northwest Region who recently traveled internationally. To protect the family's privacy, no further details about the patient will be disclosed, per VDH policy. Health officials are actively working to identify anyone who may have been exposed.
 
 
 
 ""This first case of measles in Virginia this year [2025] is a reminder of how easily this highly contagious disease can spread, particularly with international travel,"" said VDH State Epidemiologist Laurie Forlano, DO, MPH. ""Vaccination remains our best defense against measles and is safe and highly effective at protecting people and preventing outbreaks. We urge Virginians, especially those planning to travel, to check their vaccination status, talk to their health care provider, and get the MMR vaccine if needed.""
 
 
 
 Listed below are the dates, times, and locations of potential exposure sites in Virginia:
 
 - Kaiser Permanente Caton Hill Medical Center, Advanced Urgent Care, located at 13285 Minnieville Road in Woodbridge on Tuesday, April 15, from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
 
 - Kaiser Permanente Fredericksburg Medical Center, Pediatrics Department, located at 1201 Hospital Drive in Fredericksburg, on Wednesday, April 16, from noon to 5 p.m.
 
 
 
 The CDC reports 712 confirmed measles cases across 25 states as of April 11, 2025. Nearby, the Maryland Department of Health reported 3 cases in March [2025], including one in a Prince George's County elementary school.

 [3] Missouri (Taney County): nonresident international traveler

 Missouri health department announces first measles case of 2025
 
 ---------------------------------------------------
 
 Missouri's first confirmed measles case of the year involves a child in Taney County, the health department announced Friday afternoon [18 Apr 2025]. The child's vaccination status ""has not yet been verified,"" according to the press release.
 
 
 
 The child, who is not a Missouri resident, was visiting Taney County and was diagnosed ""soon after arrival,"" Lisa Cox, spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release. Taney County is in southwest Missouri, and its largest city is Branson.
 
 
 
 ""Exposure is believed to be limited, and known contacts have been identified and contacted,"" Cox said, adding that the state is supporting Taney County's health department to investigate possible exposure. The case is ""associated with recent international travel,"" Cox said.
 
 
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus the country declared eliminated 25 years ago, but that has resurged with falling vaccination rates. ""For those unvaccinated or those unsure of their vaccination status, now is the time to review records and get caught up if needed,"" Dr. George Turabelidze, state epidemiologist with DHSS, said in the press release.
 
 
 
 The percent of Missouri kindergarteners fully vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella has declined over the last several years, from 95% in the 2019-2020 school year to 91% in the 2023-2024 school year, in public schools, per DHHS data. In private schools, the drop has been even larger, from 92% to 85% in the same period.
 
 
 
 Nationally, there are at least 800 reported cases of measles across 25 states, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data as of Friday [18 Apr 2025]. That doesn't include Missouri's case, Cox said, because the state received lab test results Thursday night [17 Apr 2025], after the federal reporting deadline for this week.
 
 
 
 That is the highest number for a single year since 2019 and is still growing. The majority of measles infections nationally have been reported in a West Texas outbreak. There have been 2 confirmed deaths, both in Texas.
 
 
 
 Kansas has reported 37 cases, possibly linked to the Texas outbreak. There are outbreaks in Canada and Mexico, too, and several states have reported isolated cases as the result of international travel. At the same time, the federal government has cut grant funding set aside for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services to encourage vaccinations, according to St. Louis Public Radio.

 2025 Measles Outbreak Guidance
 
 ---------------------------
 
 
 
 Overview
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.
 
 
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 Reports
 
 The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles originating in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is highly contagious, additional cases are likely to occur.
 
 
 
 We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays by noon Mountain Standard Time if there are new cases to report.
 
 
 
 Total cases: 65
 
 Vaccinated with at least one dose: 6
 
 Not vaccinated: 47
 
 Unknown: 12
 
 
 
 New Mexico Case Count by County (as of 22 Apr 2025):
 
 County / Cases / Hospitalizations / Deaths
 
 Lea County / 61 / 5 / 1
 
 Eddy / 2 / 0 / 0
 
 Chaves / 1 / 0 / 0
 
 Do√±a Ana / 1 / 1 / 0
 
 
 
 Age Ranges of Measles Cases
 
 0-4 years: 18
 
 5-17 years: 19
 
 18+ years: 28
 
 Pending: 0
 
 Total: 65
 
 
 
 Measles is primarily a disease of people who are not immunized and most residents in the outbreak area are protected from measles disease even if they are exposed to the virus. We expect to continue to identify new measles infections associated with this regional outbreak in New Mexico and Texas. This is not the explosive situation that we see with a pandemic where the population is unprotected. The measles cases that we have confirmed include persons with positive laboratory tests and persons who developed measles symptoms at the appropriate time following contact with a confirmed case. These cases were identified in the course of careful (epidemiologic) investigations. The newly added cases include people who were ill previously and were not identified until after their illness. The timing of rash onset for the current 65 cases shows them to be spread out over time and are not increasing dramatically:
 
 
 
 Week 1 (2/9-15): 14
 
 Week 2 (2/16-22): 6
 
 Week 3 (2/23-3/1): 8
 
 Week 4 (3/2-8): 6
 
 Week 5 (3/9-15): 6
 
 Week 6 (3/16-22): 3
 
 Week 7 (3/23-29): 6
 
 Week 8 (3/30-4/5): 10
 
 Week 9 (4/6-12): 4
 
 Week 10 (4/13-19): 2

 Measles Outbreak -- April 22, 2025
 
 ------------------------
 
 
 
 The Texas Department of State Health Services is reporting an outbreak of measles primarily in West Texas.
 
 - At this time, 624 cases have been confirmed since late January 2025. This is an increase of 27 since the April 18 [2025] update.
 
 - Less than 2%, or fewer than 10 of the confirmed cases, are estimated to be actively infectious since their rash onset date was less than a week ago.
 
 - Individuals are infectious 4 days prior to and 4 days after rash onset.
 
 
 
 Sixty-four of the patients have been hospitalized. This number is the total number of people hospitalized over the course of the outbreak. It is not the current number of people in the hospital. There have been 2 fatalities in school-aged children who lived in the outbreak area. The children were not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.
 
 
 
 Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities. Based on the most recent data, DSHS has identified designated outbreak counties with ongoing measles transmission: Cochran, Dallam, Dawson, Gaines, Garza, Lynn, Lamar, Lubbock, Terry and Yoakum.
 
 
 
 DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.

 Measles cases +4 more outside Viet Nam
 
 ---------------------------------------------
 
 There were 4 new cases of measles in the country last week, 2 from local and 2 from overseas. CDC spokesman Luo Yijun said that the 2 local cases were contacts of a previously imported case who had sought medical treatment, and the 2 overseas cases both had a history of traveling to Viet Nam.
 
 
 
 This year [2025], both overseas and local cases have reached a 6-year high. In addition to taking children to receive publicly funded vaccines as per the vaccination schedule, the public is also reminded to pay attention to whether there is any overlap in footprints with confirmed cases, such as the Linkou Mitsui outlet. The case will be monitored until 25 Apr 2025.
 
 
 
 Epidemic prevention physician Lin Yongqing pointed out that the 2 new local cases were both male babies under one year of age from the north. They were contacts of an imported case from Viet Nam, a one-year-old boy who went to the clinic for medical treatment on 24 Mar 202]. The 2 male babies developed symptoms such as fever and runny nose on 3 and 4 Apr 2025, respectively. On 7 Apr 2025, the symptoms had not improved, so they went to the hospital, which reported suspected measles. They were confirmed on 11 Apr 2025.
 
 
 
 Luo Yijun said that the Taoyuan City Health Bureau had released the above-mentioned infectious period footprints on 12 Apr 2025, such as Linkou Mitsui Outlet 2 on the evening of 30 Mar 2025, and the high-speed rail from Taoyuan to Zuoying on the morning of 3 Apr 2025. A total of 524 contacts have been identified and will be monitored until 25 Apr 2025. This cluster includes a total of 3 cases imported from outside Viet Nam. It is the second measles cluster this year [2025]. Both clusters are related to cases imported from outside Viet Nam.
 
 
 
 In addition, there were 2 imported cases, a one-year-old boy from central Viet Nam and a woman in her 30s from northern Viet Nam. Both had a history of traveling to Viet Nam, such as Ca Mau Province and Phu Quoc Island. They became ill after returning to the country and were diagnosed through medical examinations.
 
 
 
 As of 14 Apr 2025, there have been a total of 26 measles cases, with ages ranging from 10 to over 60 years old, including 10 local cases and 16 imported cases. Both overseas and local cases are the highest in the same period in 2020 and the past 6 years. All 16 overseas cases were infected in Viet Nam.
 
 
 
 Guo Hongwei, director of the epidemic center, said that as of early April this year [2025], Viet Nam has reported more than 54 000 cases, with many severe cases of adults and the first adult death this year. In addition, neighboring countries Japan reported 58 cases and South Korea reported 35 cases as of early April [2025], nearly twice as many as the same period last year [2024]. Most of the cases in the 2 countries are related to imports from outside Viet Nam. The epidemic situation in North America is severe, with the number of cases in the United States and Canada so far this year [2025] exceeding the number of cases in the whole of last year [2024].
 
 
 
 Due to the continued increase in imported measles cases from abroad, there have been cases of young children who have not been vaccinated on schedule and have been infected with measles in epidemic areas, which have led to subsequent cluster infections among infants and young children in domestic clinics after returning to their home countries.
 
 
 
 Luo Yijun called for attention to the fact that measles is highly contagious, and infants and young children infected with measles may develop complications such as otitis media, pneumonia, and encephalitis. The mortality rate in infants or immunocompromised children can reach 5 to 10%. Children who are 12 months old and 5 years old to before entering primary school should each receive one dose of MMR vaccine. Completing 2 doses of vaccination can achieve a preventive effect of more than 95%. Avoid taking children under one year old or who are unvaccinated to epidemic areas. Go to a health center or travel medicine clinic to evaluate and get the MMR vaccine at your own expense to reduce the risk of infection.
 
 
 
 The CDC reminds that the global measles epidemic is currently ongoing. Chinese people should pay attention to personal hygiene at all times when traveling abroad, wash their hands frequently, avoid touching their mouths and noses, and wear masks when appropriate. If you have suspected measles symptoms such as fever, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, cough, rash, etc. when returning to the country, you should actively inform the airport quarantine personnel upon entry and cooperate with the health assessment. If you develop suspected measles symptoms within 3 weeks of returning to the country, you should wear a mask and seek medical attention as soon as possible, and actively inform your doctor of your travel history and related contact history. When seeing a patient, the physician should inquire about TOCC (travel history, occupational history, contact history, cluster history) and measles-related vaccination history.

 Taiwan measles cases reach 6-year high
 
 --------------------------------------
 
 Local and imported measles cases in Taiwan have hit a 6-year high, with all 4 clusters tied to Vietnam.
 
 
 
 Lee Chia-lin, deputy director of the CDC Epidemic Intelligence Center, said 2 new confirmed cases were reported last week [week of 13 Apr 2025], one imported and one domestic, marking the 4th cluster this year [2025], per CNA. In total, 28 measles cases have been confirmed in Taiwan this year [2025], including 11 domestic and 17 imported, all record highs for the same period over the past 6 years.
 
 
 
 CDC Spokesperson Lo Yi-chun said that all 17 imported cases originated from Vietnam, and all 4 domestic clusters were also associated with imported cases from that country. Lo said it is believed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, disruptions in routine childhood immunization schedules led to decreased vaccination coverage.
 
 
 
 Lo said that measles vaccine coverage in some areas of Vietnam reportedly dropped as low as 70%. While the outbreak there has shown signs of easing due to increased vaccination efforts, Lo said imported cases are expected to continue into the first half of the year [2025].
 
 
 
 On the global front, Lee said the measles outbreak remains severe. According to Lee, Vietnam reported over 4100 new cases and 2 deaths between 12 and 17 Apr 2025.
 
 
 
 As of mid-April [2025], the country had accumulated 76 000 cases, said Lee. While the spread is slowing, severe cases among adults are rising, and fatalities have been reported. 
 
 
 
 In India, Indonesia, and Pakistan, 3600 to 20 000 cases have been reported since the end of last year [2024], said Lee. The outbreak in North America is also serious, with the US reporting 800 cases across 25 states as of 17 Apr 2025.
 
 
 
 Lo advised travelers to Vietnam to maintain good personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, avoiding touching the mouth and nose, and wearing masks in crowded areas. Lo said travelers returning from Vietnam should watch for symptoms such as fever, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, cough, and rash within three weeks and inform their doctor of their travel history.
 
  
 
 He emphasized that children should complete their full schedule of publicly-funded vaccinations, as unvaccinated infants under one-year-old who contract measles without proper treatment face a mortality rate of up to 2%.
 
 
 
 Regarding the domestic risk of a measles outbreak, Lo said there is cause for concern but no need for panic. Lo said Taiwan's measles vaccination rate for young children exceeds 98%, providing sufficient herd immunity.
 
 
 
 However, due to limited availability of privately purchased vaccines, Lo said priority should still be given to high-risk groups such as healthcare workers and airline crew members. Lo said the public is not currently advised to get self-paid vaccinations before traveling to Vietnam, to avoid diverting doses from those at higher risk.
 
 
 
 Lo added that over 30 000 additional doses are expected to enter the commercial vaccine market in early May [2025]. Once the supply stabilizes, Lo said vaccination guidelines may be revised accordingly.

 [Editado por Jaime Torres]
 
 
 
 
 
 El Ministerio de Salud de la Provincia confirm√≥ que ya son 20 los casos de sarampi√≥n detectados en el √Årea Metropolitana de Buenos Aires (AMBA) e inform√≥ que, como parte del operativo de contenci√≥n, se habilit√≥ un servicio de asistencia m√©dica virtual para pacientes que presenten s√≠ntomas compatibles con la enfermedad.
 
 
 
 La herramienta, disponible en el portal Mi Salud Digital Bonaerense, permite que profesionales de la salud respondan consultas de lunes a viernes, de 8 a 20. El equipo est√° conformado por 200 m√©dicos y m√©dicas de hospitales p√∫blicos provinciales.
 
 
 
 Seg√∫n el √∫ltimo Bolet√≠n Epidemiol√≥gico bonaerense, diez de los casos registrados pertenecen a residentes de la Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires (CABA) y los otros diez a la provincia. Los dos casos m√°s recientes son beb√©s de 10 y 11 meses que viven en Almirante Brown y Avellaneda, respectivamente.
 
 
 
 El primer brote identificado corresponde al genotipo B3 del virus del sarampi√≥n. En este grupo se encuentran nueve de los casos bonaerenses, distribuidos en los partidos de Florencio Varela (4), Quilmes (1), Berazategui (1), Presidente Per√≥n (1), Almirante Brown (1) y Avellaneda (1). Ocho de ellos tuvieron contacto directo con personas previamente diagnosticadas, mientras que el noveno se encuentra en estudio epidemiol√≥gico por no contar con ese antecedente. Adem√°s, se notific√≥ un caso importado en el partido de Moreno, vinculado a un nuevo brote con virus genotipo D8. Hasta el momento, no se detectaron contagios secundarios asociados a ese caso.
 
 
 
 En total, ya se identificaron m√°s de 750 contactos estrechos de los casos confirmados, de los cuales 302 completaron el per√≠odo de seguimiento. La situaci√≥n es monitoreada por una mesa de trabajo conjunta entre los ministerios de Salud de Naci√≥n, CABA y Provincia.
 
 
 
 El 7 de abril se puso en marcha una campa√±a de vacunaci√≥n focalizada en ni√±os y ni√±as del AMBA. Esta estrategia aplica una ‚Äúdosis cero‚Äù de la vacuna doble viral (sarampi√≥n y rub√©ola) para menores de entre 6 y 11 meses, y una dosis adicional para el grupo de 13 meses a 4 a√±os.
 
 
 
 El objetivo es interrumpir cadenas de transmisi√≥n y proteger a los grupos de mayor riesgo. La campa√±a ya se implement√≥ inicialmente en Florencio Varela y Quilmes, donde se detectaron los primeros casos.
 
 
 
 Hasta el momento se aplicaron 4.427 dosis a beb√©s de entre 6 y 11 meses, y 13.092 dosis adicionales a menores de entre 13 meses y 4 a√±os, en distintos municipios del AMBA. Tambi√©n se est√°n completando esquemas regulares de vacunaci√≥n en los contactos identificados.
 
 
 
 El Ministerio de Salud advierte que el riesgo de brotes de sarampi√≥n se incrementa debido a la baja cobertura de vacunaci√≥n con la triple viral, que protege contra sarampi√≥n, rub√©ola y paperas. Por eso, se insiste en la necesidad de completar los esquemas seg√∫n el calendario nacional y aplicar las dosis extra indicadas.

 Kansas measles outbreak: Governor and KDHE provide update
 
 --------------------------------------------------
 
 Kansas Governor Laura Kelly urged Kansans to get their measles vaccines in a news conference with Dr. Dereck Totten of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and local officials in Garden City Tuesday [22 Apr 2025].
 
 
 
 Kansas currently has 37 cases in 8 counties in the southwest part of the state, health officials announced Tuesday. Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray, and Morton counties each have fewer than 5 cases. Haskell County has the most cases, with 8, Stevens County has 7, and Kiowa County has 6.
 
 
 
 The state's first reported case, identified in Stevens County on 13 Mar [2025], is linked to the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks based on genetic testing, a state health department spokesperson said. But health officials have not determined how the person was exposed.
 
 
 
 Measles can cause serious health complications, especially in children younger than 5. So far, no Kansas cases have required hospitalization.
 
 
 
 According to the CDC, measles is highly contagious. The virus can linger in the air for up to 2 hours.

 Minnesota reports 2nd measles case as health officials urge vaccinations
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Minnesota has reported a second measles case in 2025, as health officials are urging parents to get their children vaccinated amid a nationwide outbreak. Minnesota health officials say the new case involves an infant who was diagnosed while in another country. Health officials said the child is too young to receive the MMR vaccine.
 
 
 
 ""The child was likely infectious while abroad, but was not infectious when they returned to Minnesota, so no exposures occurred in Minnesota,"" a Minnesota Department of Health spokesperson said.
 
 
 
 Last year [2024], Minnesota saw its most measles cases in 7 years, with the state reporting 70 cases. Since 2010, the only time the state saw more cases was in 2017, when the state reported 75.

 Arkansas Department of Health confirms 3rd positive measles case
 
 ---------------------------------------------------
 
 According to the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH), there are now 3 confirmed measles cases in the state.
 
 
 
 The ADH announced the first positive case on the afternoon of Thu 10 Apr 2025, when a positive case of measles had been identified in Saline County. According to ADH officials, the case was identified in an Arkansan who was unvaccinated against the illness. Additionally, they said that the Arkansan was exposed to the illness during a visit out of state.
 
 
 
 The ADH said that the individual visited 4 different locations while infectious. Here's a look at the locations and the times that they visited each place:
 
 
 
 - Baptist Health Urgent Care on Military Road in Benton on 6 Apr between 3:30 and 6:09 p.m.
 
 - Saline Memorial Hospital Emergency Department on 6 Apr between 6:30 and 10:30 p.m.
 
 - Benton Family Clinic on 8 Apr between 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.
 
 - Arkansas Children's Emergency Department on 8 Apr between 11:49 a.m. and 5:59 p.m.
 
 
 
 Meanwhile, the ADH confirmed that a second positive case of pediatric measles had been confirmed in an unvaccinated Arkansas resident from Faulkner County. Reports say that the child who tested positive was exposed during out-of-state travel.
 
 
 
 The child reportedly visited the following locations while infectious:
 
 
 
 - Arkansas Pediatrics of Conway on 7 Apr 2025 from 9:10 to 11:25 a.m. and 4:00 to 6:45 p.m.
 
 - Arkansas Children's Emergency Department on 9 Apr 2025 from 1:15 to 8:40 p.m.
 
 
 
 No information has been released just yet regarding the county where the third positive measles case was found or whether it is an adult or pediatric case. However, officials with the Arkansas Department of Health did confirm that there have been no official public exposure locations that have been identified since 10 Apr 2025.

 Louisiana Department of Health confirms 2nd New Orleans area measles case
 
 ----------------------------------------
 
 The Louisiana Department of Health has confirmed a second case of measles in the New Orleans area. At a news conference held Monday [21 Apr 2025] by the LDH, they confirmed a second case but didn't give any information on whether the person was vaccinated or unvaccinated.
 
 
 
 Louisiana Department of Health Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham stated that contact tracing helped them find the second patient.
 
 
 
 ""Now this case is an older case, not infectious at all, but if it hadn't been for the great team that Dr. Pete Krogan and his team of tracers, his whole team worked very hard through the weekend. On Easter Sunday, the contact tracing that have helped find this second patient would not have happened. So we certainly wanted to be very transparent, very open,"" said Dr. Abraham.
 
 
 
 This is the first [locally acquired] measles case reported in Louisiana in 2025, which was on Sunday. In 2024, 3 confirmed travel-associated measles cases were reported in Louisiana, all in the greater New Orleans area.

1-month-old dies from antibiotic-resistant whooping cough in Tokyo
-----------------------------------------
A one-month-old girl without underlying health conditions died after being infected with whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory disease that causes severe coughing, the Japan Institute for Health Security (JIHS) revealed in an 18 Apr [2025] report.

According to the JIHS, the girl began coughing and was hospitalized after her respiratory condition worsened. She was diagnosed with whooping cough, and on the fourth day in hospital she was transferred to the Tokyo Metropolitan Children's Medical Center with respiratory failure. She was placed on a ventilator, and also showed signs of pneumonia.

By the third day after the transfer, the infant's respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension had worsened, and her kidneys started failing. She was placed on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine to provide heart and lung support and also underwent dialysis, but passed away on the fifth day at the medical center. She had not yet received any vaccinations, and her mother had not been inoculated during pregnancy.

The girl was infected with an antibiotic-resistant strain of the bacteria. Between November 2024 and March 2025, a total of 5 similar cases involving resistant bacteria strains were reported at the same medical center, including the deceased baby. None of these patients had a history of traveling overseas, and it is suspected that the disease was transmitted from their siblings or other household members.

According to the JIHS' preliminary data, 722 new cases of whooping cough were reported nationwide during the week leading up to 6 Apr [2025]. The total number of patients this year [2025] has reached 5652, already surpassing the 4054 patients reported throughout all of last year [2024].

The JIHS noted that antibiotic-resistant strains may be spreading in Tokyo, but emphasized that vaccination remains effective.

Whooping cough cases in Japan hit record high for third straight week
--------------------
Cases of whooping cough in Japan have hit a record high for the third week in a row.

Whooping cough is an infectious bacterial disease that affects the respiratory system. It is characterized by severe, persistent coughing and can be fatal for infants up to 6 months old.

The Japan Institute for Health Security says medical institutions across the country reported 1222 cases in the week through 13 Apr [2025]. The figure was 500 more than the previous week and the highest since the current method of record keeping began in 2018.

The number of cases since the beginning of this year [2025] stands at 7084, already surpassing last year's total by about 3000.

There have been reports this year of infants dying or becoming seriously ill, and of infections involving drug-resistant bacteria.

The Japan Pediatric Society is urging parents to immediately vaccinate infants who have turned 2 months old.

 Fifth measles case in WA confirmed, locations revealed
 
 ------------------------------------------------
 
 An infant in King County contracted measles, making it the fifth case in 2025 in Washington. Public Health - Seattle and King County reported that the infant traveled through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac) last Tuesday [15 Apr 2025] while infectious with measles and was at some specific locations at Seattle Children's Hospital while contagious. The infant had not yet been vaccinated against the measles and was likely exposed during a recent trip out of the country.
 
 
 
 ""Measles outbreaks are happening in every part of the world. If you are planning international travel, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider about what vaccines may be needed,"" Elysia Gonzales, medical epidemiologist for Public Health - Seattle & King County, said. ""Children need 2 doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.""
 
 
 
 Of the 5 measles cases in Washington in 2025, 3 were infants.
 
 
 
 The specific locations where the infant with measles was
 
 ---
 
 On April 15 [2025], the infant and their family were at Sea-Tac Airport from 4:50 p.m. until 7:45 p.m. They were at S Concourse (Gate S10), the international arrivals facility for customs, and baggage claim (Carousel 21) before exiting through Gina Marie Hall (south end of main terminal).
 
 
 
 Two days later [17 Apr 2025], the family went to Seattle Children's Hospital's Emergency Department from 8:45 a.m. to 1 p.m. and again from 5:30 p.m. until 7:45 p.m. Beyond the waiting room, the infant was also in the Forest B level 1 lobby and its pharmacy.
 
 
 
 The next day, April 18 [2025], the family returned to Seattle Children's Hospital's Emergency Department. From 11:50 a.m. until 3:30 p.m., the infant and the family were in the Ocean 6, 7, and 8 lobbies, the Ocean 7 Starbucks, the Ocean 8 hallway to urgent care, and the Ocean 8 urgent care lobby.
 
 
 
 On April 20 [2025], from 12:05 pm until 2:25 pm the family visited Ocean 6, 7, and 8 lobbies, the Ocean 8 hallway to urgent care, and the Ocean 8 urgent care lobby at the Seattle Children's Hospital's Emergency Department.
 
 
 
 If you were at the locations at the times listed above and are not immune to measles, the most likely time‚ÄØyou would become sick would be between April 22 and May 11 [2025]. People who are immunocompromised may take longer to experience symptoms.

 Illinois reports first measles case of 2025
 
 ---------------------------
 
 The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has confirmed that the first measles case of 2025 has been reported in the state. The IDPH said on April 23 [2025], laboratory testing confirmed that an adult in southern Illinois had contracted measles. As of Wednesday evening [23 Apr 2025], this is the only case IDPH is aware of, and it is not considered an outbreak. Officials added that the risk of community transmission for the general public in Illinois is still low.
 
 
 
 The IDPH will update the public if there are any ""notable developments.""
 
 
 
 This is the first measles case to be reported in Illinois since an outbreak in Chicago in early 2024 that resulted in 67 cases. But, the IDPH has been monitoring the outbreak in Texas and New Mexico, which resulted in more than 680 confirmed cases. Nationally, the CDC has reported 800 cases of measles.

 2nd child from Ingham County has measles after exposure to baby girl with virus
 
 -----------------------------------------------
 
 A 1-year-old boy in Ingham County now has the measles, state and county health officials announced April 23 [2025], one day after confirming that he was infected following exposure to a 12-month-old girl who also has the highly contagious virus. The boy's family was contacted by communicable disease nurses from the Ingham County Health Department after he was exposed to the 12-month-old girl, whose measles infection was confirmed April 15 [2025]. When he developed symptoms, he was immediately tested.
 
 
 
 The boy was vaccinated with an age-appropriate one dose of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, Dr. Nike Shoyinka, the county's medical health officer, said in a statement. But the single dose wasn't enough to fully protect him from illness. His symptoms, however, are mild.
 
 
 
 This is at least the eighth confirmed measles case in Michigan so far in 2025. An outbreak was declared April 17 [2025] in Montcalm County, and an additional case in Eaton County is still awaiting confirmation, said Emily Smale, a spokesperson from the Barry-Eaton District Health Department told the Free Press.

 Key Points
 
 ----------
 
 Question: How will declining childhood vaccination rates affect the risk of outbreaks and reemergence of previously eliminated infectious diseases in the USA?
 
 
 
 Findings: At current state-level vaccination rates, measles may become endemic again; increasing vaccine coverage would prevent this. Under a 50% decline in childhood vaccination in the USA, the simulation model predicted 51.2 million measles cases over a 25-year period, 9.9 million rubella cases, 4.3 million poliomyelitis cases, 197 diphtheria cases, 10.3 million hospitalizations, and 159‚ÄØ200 deaths.
 
 
 
 Meaning: Childhood vaccination at a high coverage level is needed to prevent resurgence of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases and their infection-related complications in the USA.
 
 
 
 Abstract
 
 --------
 
 Importance: Widespread childhood vaccination has eliminated many infectious diseases in the USA. However, vaccination rates are declining, and there are ongoing policy debates to reduce the childhood vaccine schedule, which may risk reemergence of previously eliminated infectious diseases.
 
 
 
 Objective: To estimate the number of cases and complications in the USA under scenarios of declining childhood vaccination for measles, rubella, poliomyelitis, and diphtheria.
 
 
 
 Design, Setting, and Participants: A simulation model was used to assess the importation and dynamic spread of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases across 50 USA states and the District of Columbia. The model was parameterized with data on area-specific estimates for demography, population immunity, and infectious disease importation risk. The model evaluated scenarios with different vaccination rates over a 25-year period. Inputs for current childhood vaccination rates were based on 2004-2023 data.
 
 
 
 Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were estimated cases of measles, rubella, poliomyelitis, and diphtheria in the USA. The secondary outcomes were estimated rates of infection-related complications (postmeasles neurological sequelae, congenital rubella syndrome, paralytic poliomyelitis, hospitalization, and death) and the probability and timing for an infection to reestablish endemicity.
 
 
 
 Results: At current state-level vaccination rates, the simulation model predicts measles may reestablish endemicity (83% of simulations; mean time of 20.9 years) with an estimated 851‚ÄØ300 cases (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 381‚ÄØ300 to 1.3 million cases) over 25 years. Under a scenario with a 10% decline in measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination, the model estimates 11.1 million (95% UI, 10.1-12.1 million) cases of measles over 25 years, whereas the model estimates only 5800 cases (95% UI, 3100-19‚ÄØ400 cases) with a 5% increase in MMR vaccination. Other vaccine-preventable diseases are unlikely to reestablish endemicity under current levels of vaccination. If routine childhood vaccination declined by 50%, the model predicts 51.2 million (95% UI, 49.7-52.5 million) cases of measles over a 25-year period, 9.9 million (95% UI, 6.4-13.0 million) cases of rubella, 4.3 million cases (95% UI, 4 cases to 21.5 million cases) of poliomyelitis, and 197 cases (95% UI, 1-1000 cases) of diphtheria. Under this scenario, the model predicts 51‚ÄØ200 cases (95% UI, 49‚ÄØ600-52‚ÄØ600 cases) with postmeasles neurological sequelae, 10‚ÄØ700 cases (95% UI, 6700-14‚ÄØ600 cases) of congenital rubella syndrome, 5400 cases (95% UI, 0-26‚ÄØ300 cases) of paralytic poliomyelitis, 10.3 million hospitalizations (95% UI, 9.9-10.5 million hospitalizations), and 159‚ÄØ200 deaths (95% UI, 151‚ÄØ200-164‚ÄØ700 deaths). In this scenario, measles became endemic at 4.9 years (95% UI, 4.3-5.6 years) and rubella became endemic at 18.1 years (95% UI, 17.0-19.6 years), whereas poliovirus returned to endemic levels in about half of simulations (56%) at an estimated 19.6 years (95% UI, 14.0-24.7 years). There was large variation across the US population.
 
 
 
 Conclusions and Relevance: Based on estimates from this modeling study, declining childhood vaccination rates will increase the frequency and size of outbreaks of previously eliminated vaccine-preventable infections, eventually leading to their return to endemic levels. The timing and critical threshold for returning to endemicity will differ substantially by disease, with measles likely to be the first to return to endemic levels and may occur even under current vaccination levels without improved vaccine coverage and public health response. These findings support the need to continue routine childhood vaccination at high coverage to prevent resurgence of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in the US.

 Overall, the province is reporting 29 new cases of measles, bringing the total since early March [2025] up to 118. Most new cases are either in the South or Central zones, with 7 in the North and 1 in Edmonton. The province says all but 12 of the total cases are no longer contagious, with most involving children from 5 to 17 years old. As of the government's latest numbers, 8 Albertans have been hospitalized since the 1st case was diagnosed.
 
 
 
 Residents are reminded that anyone born in or after 1970 and has fewer than 2 documented doses of measles-containing vaccine, is at risk for developing measles. Such individuals who were present at potential spread events are asked to monitor themselves closely for symptoms of measles.
 
 
 
 Symptoms of measles include a fever of 38.3¬∞C [100.94 deg F] or higher, cough, runny nose and/or red eyes and a rash that appears 3 to 7 days after fever starts. This rash usually begins behind the ears and on the face and spreads down to the body and then to the arms and legs. The rash is often red and blotchy on lighter skin colors, but on darker skin colors it can appear purple or darker than the skin around it, or it might be hard to see, said AHS.
 
 
 
 Following a measles exposure, vaccine given within 72 hours can prevent infection. Measles vaccine is highly effective at preventing infection and complications. In Alberta, measles vaccines are offered, free of charge ,through Alberta's publicly funded immunization program. Those unsure of their vaccination history can text 'vaccine record' to 88111, call Health Link (811) or call their local public health or community health centre.

Health officials in South Sudanâ€™s Lakes State have reported cases of chickenpox and suspected measles at Rumbek Central Prison, with 24 infections identified among inmates.

State Health Director General Maker Malok said on Saturday [19 Apr 2025] that 2 elderly inmates were severely infected, while the rest were between 25 and 30 years old.

Malok told Radio Tamazuj on Monday [21 Apr 2025] that health workers, with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), were providing calamine lotion, painkillers, and allergy medications to treat rashes. He praised prison medical staff for monitoring new cases but warned that infections could spread rapidly due to overcrowding and the arrival of inmates from different areas.

However, Rumbek State Hospital Director Dr. Terran Madit said health teams had confirmed the outbreak was chickenpox -- not measles -- but cautioned that it could still spread further.

About 10 inmates were severely affected and were receiving antibiotics and calamine lotion, he said.

""The cause of this outbreak is overcrowding,"" Madit said, adding that officials had urged the prison director to work with lawyers and judges to ease congestion.

Civil society activist Daniel Laat Kon also confirmed the outbreak, blaming excessive inmate numbers.

""The large number of people being held without trial is a big problem,"" Kon said, calling on the judiciary to expedite cases to reduce overcrowding.

 <https://thenationonlineng.net/jigawa-records-two-new-polio-cases-after-a-decade-of-being-virus-free-unicef/>
 
 
 
 
 
 Two new cases of polio have been confirmed in Hadejia and Suletankarkar local government areas of Jigawa State, marking a setback after nearly a decade of being declared polio free.
 
 
 
 The disclosure was made by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) during a media dialogue on polio and routine immunisation held in Dutse, the state capital.
 
 
 
 Speaking on behalf of UNICEF Kano Chief Field Officer Mr. Rahama Rihood Farah, Health Manager Dr. Serekeberehan Seyoum Deres warned that polio remains a highly contagious disease with severe consequences, including paralysis and death among young children.
 
 
 
 Deres highlighted that although over 3 billion people have been vaccinated against polio globally since 1988, the fight against the disease is far from over due to low vaccination rates in some regions.
 
 
 
 ""In 2025 alone, 18 cases of polio have been reported across 18 local government areas in 9 states in Nigeria,"" he noted, calling for renewed efforts in vaccination and surveillance to prevent further outbreaks.
 
 
 
 ""Two (2) of these polio cases are in Hadejia and Sule Tankarkar LGAs of Jigawa state. This is unacceptable and must be halted. Polio knows no boundaries and spreads fast. An outbreak in any country puts children in every country at risk"".
 
 
 
 The chief field officer maintained: ""In the last 50 years alone, vaccines have saved 154 million lives -- that is 6 people every minute, for 5 decades. Together, we have made incredible progress. Simply by being immunized, you help to protect others from the spread of disease, just as they help to protect you. We can stop outbreaks and eradicate polio"".
 
 
 
 ""Ending polio and improving children's survival starts with making sure all children have access to vaccines. UNICEF calls on the Jigawa state government, and indeed all states in Nigeria, to take urgent action to stop polio outbreaks and to reach all children with polio and other life-saving vaccines"".
 
 
 
 He said UNICEF requests Jigawa State government to declare a state of emergency on polio and routine immunization, including a commitment to release state counterpart funding for polio and routine immunization; for 27 local government councils' chairmen in the state to make similar commitments; and to conduct flag-offs of the upcoming polio vaccination campaign and commit to releasing counterpart funding.
 
 
 
 Serekeberehan Seyoum noted that UNICEF in collaboration with the Jigawa state government through the Primary Healthcare Development Agency has convened this media dialogue to solicit the support of the media in raising awareness and mobilising parents, caregivers, communities, stakeholders, the public, and everyone about the polio vaccination campaign, which Nigeria has scheduled to implement from 24 to 30 Apr 2025.
 
 
 
 UNICEF emphasized that media must regularly disseminate through their platforms accurate information to help fight myths, disinformation, and rumors, which misinform and discourage people from taking opportunities to vaccinate children.
 
 
 
 ""If children get vaccinated routinely, we will have no need for vaccination campaigns to deal with vaccine-preventable diseases. To eradicate polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases, Nigeria must strengthen its routine immunization efforts. This requires full implementation of the ""one functional primary healthcare centre per ward"" policy. If we strengthen our routine immunization, we can realize a future free from diseases like polio, cervical cancer, and measles.""
 
 
 
 Farah stated further that the global community is focusing attention on human papillomavirus during World Immunization Week, and UNICEF urges the government and decision-makers in Nigeria to also focus attention on and invest in vaccination against the human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer.
 
 
 
 ""We can realise a future free from vaccine-preventable diseases like polio, cervical cancer, and measles -- a future where no child dies from illnesses that we know how to prevent -- because vaccines are available, safe, and effective!""
 
 
 
 Speaking over the development, the executive secretary Jigawa state Primary Healthcare Development Agency PHCDA, Dr Sambo, through director primary healthcare services, Dr Hassan Shu'aibu Kwalam, said the state has come up and adopted new strategies to re-eliminate the disease in the state.
 
 
 
 According to him, the state government, through the agency, [will hold] a massive immunization exercise to be launched all over the state by tomorrow, Wednesday [23 Apr 2025], targeted to immunize all eligible children in the state.
 
 
 
 The director explained that a high-level meeting with traditional and religious leaders, under the chairmanship of the chairman of polio enlightenment campaign committee and Emir of Dutse, Alhaji Muhammad Hamim Nuhu, [has been] redesigned, where the Emir of Hadejia and Gumel, Alhaji Adamu Abubakar Make and Alhaji Ahmed Muhammed Sani, [can] review the (polio) immunization exercise in Hadejia.
 
 
 
 Dr Hassan Shu'aibu Kwalam explained that there is a massive immunization exercise plan to kick off 24th of this month [April 2025] and last for 6 days; during the period, over 3060 teams of 3 people per each team will be dispatched across 287 political wards in 27 local government areas to vaccinate all eligible children.
 
 
 
 He said: ""The agency received over 2 million doses of vaccine to be admitted to the targeted 1.9 million children.
 
 
 
 ""In an effort to achieve 100 percent coverage, about 50 000 ad hoc staff had been recruited, which includes people to administer the vaccine, recorders, supervisors at 3 different levels such as at teams, wards, local government area zones, and state levels.""
 
 
 
 Also speaking, programme manager, State Emergency Routine Immunisation Coordination Centre (SERICC), Dr Shehu Ibrahim, said, ""A total of 1.9 million is targeted to immunize against the polio disease in the forthcoming polio immunisation exercise to be conducted across 27 local government areas of the state"".
 
 
 
 Dr Shehu Ibrahim described non-compliance, which in most cases emanates from political attribution in vaccine exercise, leading to some children not receiving the vaccine, a situation that exposes them and endangers others to the virus.
 
 
 
 He expressed concern about political attraction to polio and routine immunization, where in some cases, rejecting the vaccine for a political reason remains a serious challenge in achieving the targeted children in the state: ""What is the relationship between water supply and routine immunization?""
 
 
 
 According to him, ""In February 2025, in an immunisation exercise, a total of 7 children were missed in Garki, Kaugama, and Maigatari local government areas.""
 
 
 
 He said that state government has introduced various measures to ensure no single child is left behind during the upcoming immunisation campaign.
 
 
 
 He added that immunisation teams would be deployed to markets and borders to ensure full coverage and to ensure no zero child is recorded.

 Overview
 
 --------
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.
 
 
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 Reports
 
 -------
 
 The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles originating in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is highly contagious, additional cases are likely to occur.
 
 We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays by noon Mountain Standard Time if there are new cases to report.

 Measles is primarily a disease of people who are not immunized and most residents in the outbreak area are protected from measles disease even if they are exposed to the virus. We expect to continue to identify new measles infections associated with this regional outbreak in New Mexico and Texas. This is not the explosive situation that we see with a pandemic where the population is unprotected. The measles cases that we have confirmed include persons with positive laboratory tests and persons who developed measles symptoms at the appropriate time following contact with a confirmed case. These cases were identified in the course of careful (epidemiologic) investigations. The newly added cases include people who were ill previously and were not identified until after their illness. The timing of rash onset for the current 66 cases shows them to be spread out over time and are not increasing dramatically:
 
 
 
 Week 1 (9-15 Feb): 14
 
 Week 2 (16-22 Feb): 6

 Measles case confirmed in Atascosa County; others potentially exposed, county says
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 A measles case has been confirmed in an Atascosa County adult resident, the county announced in a news release Tuesday [22 Apr 2025]. The adult was unvaccinated and may have exposed other people to the virus while attending a gathering, the release said.
 
 Anyone who was at the Shearit Yisrael Quahal Yehoshua Temple, located just west of Poteet city limits, on the evening of Sunday, 13 Apr 2025, may have been exposed, according to the release.
 
 
 
 The case is being investigated by the Texas Department of State Health Services Public Health Region 8 in coordination with the county.
 
 
 
 ""DSHS PHR 8 is working closely with local partners in Atascosa County to identify potential contacts, provide guidance, and reduce the risk of further transmission,"" the release said. ""Health officials are also assessing whether this case may be linked to the ongoing measles outbreak in West Texas.""
 
 
 
 On Tuesday [22 Apr 2025], the DSHS website showed 624 measles cases have been reported in Texas since late January [2025]. However, the Atascosa County case was not yet listed.

 A Collin County middle-schooler contracted measles, officials confirm
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 A Collin County middle schooler tested positive for measles, the 1st known case in a child in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, Collin County Health Care Services confirmed Tuesday [22 Apr 2025]. Health officials confirmed a case of measles involving a student who attends Willow Springs Middle School in Lucas, part of Lovejoy Independent School District. According to data from Texas Health and Human Services, 95% of 7th graders in Lovejoy ISD received an MMR vaccine in the 2023-2024 school year. 
 
 
 
 It is unclear if the student was vaccinated. Due to the patient's age, no additional information will be released, health officials said. It's also unclear if the case is linked to the warning Collin County health officials previously issued on 18 Apr 2025 about a person who tested positive for measles and visited 3 stores, including a Walmart, in Plano while still infectious.
 
 
 
 The case announced Tuesday [22 Apr 2025] was the 1st known case of a child contracting the disease in the Metroplex. Two cases previously reported in Rockwall County both involved adults, officials said. Four cases of measles, including at least one child, were announced in March [2025] by the Paris-Lamar County Health District, which is located northeast of DFW.

 Measles outbreak - 25 Apr 2025
 
 ----------------------
 
 The Texas Department of State Health Services is reporting an outbreak of measles primarily in West Texas. At this time, 646 cases have been confirmed since late January [2025]. This is an increase of 22 since the 22 April 2025 update. One percent, or fewer than 10 of the confirmed cases, are estimated to be actively infectious since their rash onset date was less than a week ago. Individuals are infectious 4 days prior to and 4 days after rash onset. Sixty-four of the patients have been hospitalized. This number is the total number of people hospitalized over the course of the outbreak. It is not the current number of people in the hospital.
 
 
 
 There have been 2 fatalities in school-aged children who lived in the outbreak area. The children were not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions. Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities.
 
 
 
 Based on the most recent data, DSHS has identified designated outbreak counties with ongoing measles transmission: Cochran, Dallam, Dawson, Gaines, Garza, Lynn, Lamar, Lubbock, Terry and Yoakum. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak.
 
 
 
 We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.

 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with 2 doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.

 Vaccinated adult from Colorado infected with measles, the state's 1st ""breakthrough"" case in 2025
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Colorado on Friday [25 Apr 2025] reported its 5th case of measles this year, and, for the 1st time in the spate of cases, the infection was in a person who had been vaccinated against the disease. The person, an adult living in Denver, had recently traveled to the Mexican state of Chihuahua, which is seeing an outbreak of measles. Two other cases identified in Colorado -- one in a baby in Denver and another in a Pueblo resident -- were also connected to travel to Chihuahua.
 
 
 
 The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment identified one location where people may have been exposed to the virus as a result of this case. Anyone who was at the Kaiser Permanente urgent care clinic at 8383 W. Alameda Ave. in Lakewood between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Saturday, 19 Apr 2025, should monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days and consider avoiding public gatherings. If you think you may be sick with measles, call ahead to your doctor's office or emergency clinic before going in to allow the staff to make sure you can be seen without risk of exposing others.
 
 
 
 The new case is unusual because it is in someone who has verified proof of MMR vaccination. But that doesn't mean such a so-called breakthrough infection is unexpected, said Dr. Ned Calonge, CDPHE's chief medical officer. Two doses of MMR vaccine are considered 97% effective at stopping an infection -- one dose is considered 93% effective. That means on average 3 out of every 100 vaccinated people who are exposed to the virus will get sick.
 
 
 
 When that happens, the illness is likely to be milder, and that is exactly what occurred in the latest Colorado case, Calonge said. He said the infected person is reported to be feeling well. Vaccinated people who develop an infection are also less infectious toward others, Calonge said.
 
 
 
 Calonge emphasized that this breakthrough infection does not mean the virus has mutated dangerously or become more adept at evading the immune system. Rather, he said, in rare cases people will not respond to the MMR vaccine or their immunity will wane over time.
 
 
 
 While state officials are optimistic about the health system's readiness to respond to measles infections, some of the earlier cases saw long delays in reporting suspected infections. That caused CDPHE to send out reminders to clinics and labs that possible measles cases need to be reported promptly to the state. In the latest case, it took nearly a week from the time the person visited the clinic to when the public was told about the confirmed case of measles. But Calonge said the clinic did inform CDPHE right away.
 
 
 
 The delay in publicly reporting the infection was because health officials looked at the vaccination status of the person and weren't certain the test result to confirm a measles infection would come back positive. 
 
 
 
 ""The decision was, based on the vaccination history, that the likelihood was low,"" Calonge said. Regardless, Calonge said anyone who has been tested for measles should isolate themselves until the test result comes back.

 TN Dept. of Health confirms measles outbreak, all 6 patients unvaccinated
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 The Tennessee Department of Health confirmed a measles outbreak in the state Friday [25 Apr 2025]. 
 
 
 
 The Department of Health said there are 6 confirmed measles cases in the state. The CDC defines an outbreak as occurring when a virus spreads among 3 or more individuals who share a connection with each other. 
 
 
 
 According to the Department of Health, there are 2 cases in the mid-Cumberland region and 4 in the upper Cumberland region. All 6 patients were unvaccinated, according to the department. Four patients are between 5 and 17 years old, 1 patient is between the ages of 18 and 49, and the final patient is over 50 years old, according to the Department of Health's data.
 
 
 
 The 1st case was confirmed on 17 Mar 2025. Three cases were confirmed between 28 and 31 Mar 2025. The final 2 cases were confirmed on 14 Apr 2025. The cases are the first confirmed case of measles in the state since 2019, and it came amid multiple reported outbreaks across the nation.
 
 
 
 The best way to prevent measles is to be vaccinated with the MMR vaccine. Children should get their 1st dose between 12 and 15 months old. The 2nd dose should be given between the ages of 4 and 6.

 Experts urge measles vaccinations as Kentucky confirms 2nd case
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Another case of measles has been confirmed in Kentucky.
 
 
 
 In February [2025], we saw the state's 1st case since 2023 in Frankfort. The CDC reports there have been 800 confirmed cases so far this year.
 
 
 
 Despite its declared elimination in 2000, a new Stanford-led study suggests that measles could become endemic.
 
 
 
 ""We should not be seeing this at all,"" said Cassie Prather with the Woodford County Health Department. Endemic means it would be present constantly.
 
 
 
 ""There are so many things that concern me about this as a public health practitioner,"" said Prather.
 
 
 
 Kentucky's Cabinet for Health and Family Services announced the 2nd case this week. They say a child who passed through Kentucky in March [2025] tested positive.
 
 
 
 Even though the child isn't a U.S. resident, the case still counts because it was diagnosed in Kentucky.
 
 
 
 ""There are no known exposures. That's my understanding at this time. However, measles is extremely contagious,"" said Prather.
 
 
 
 The state's 1st measles case was confirmed in February [2025] in an adult in Franklin County. 
 
 
 
 ""This vaccine has been around for a very long time. It's proven effective and proven safe,"" Prather said.
 
 
 
 Experts say if you're not vaccinated, you have a 90% chance of getting measles if you come in contact with an infected person.

 Measles case confirmed in Cherokee Nation Reservation
 
 -----------------------------------------------------
 
 The Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) identified a case of measles within the Cherokee Nation Reservation on 24 Apr 2025.
 
 
 
 Officials contacted the individuals who may have been exposed during 14-17 Apr 2025.
 
 
 
 The Cherokee Nation recommends that Cherokee citizens contact their primary care provider to ensure they are up to date with all vaccinations.
 
 
 
 According to the OSDH, as of Friday [25 Apr 2025], there have been 15 cases of measles identified in the state.
 
 
 
 Anyone who suspects they may have the measles or has been exposed should avoid walking into a clinic, hospital, or urgent care without calling first to protect others.

 Cases of hepatitis A and E rise in Patna amid soaring heat
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 
 Hot weather conditions have caused a spike in cases of gastrointestinal and liver-related diseases in the state capital. City-based health experts claim that the number of patients suffering from hepatitis A and E has increased to 2 to 3-fold in the last 10 days.
 
 
 
 ""Hepatitis A and E are water and food-borne diseases that tend to increase during the summer months. The hot weather creates an environment conducive to viruses to spread. At least 7 patients with symptoms of hepatitis A and E have come to my clinic in the last 2 weeks,"" said Gastroenterologist Dr Vijay Shanker.
 
 
 
 He said one notable factor contributing to the rise in such cases is the travel history of patients. ""Out of the 7 patients treated, 4 recently returned from Delhi. This shows they might have consumed contaminated food and water while traveling during the summer vacation period,"" he said. ""We have seen that after returning home, majority of people complain of bacterial or viral diarrhea and hepatitis A and E, because when they are out, they are more likely to consume contaminated food and water,"" he added.
 
 
 
 Gastroenterologist and hepatologist at Jaiprabha Medanta, Dr Ashosh Kumar Jha, said, ""The number of hepatitis A and E cases will rise further if precautions are not taken. We have seen that the spike mainly occurs from mid-May to mid-July. Hence, it is very important to take precaution now.""
 
 
 
 He advised people to avoid street food and drink only clean water. He said apart from viral hepatitis A and E, the cases of parasitic infection leading to amebiasis and colitis also increase, causing diarrhoea, fatigue, and abdominal pain. Both viruses are primarily transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food and water.
 
 
 
 Symptoms of these infections may include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).
 
 
 
 To combat the rise in hepatitis A and E cases, experts emphasise the importance of maintaining proper hygiene and sanitation practices. People should consume only safe and clean drinking water, wash their hands regularly with soap and water, and practice good food handling and preparation techniques, they added.

 Victorian health officials warn of outbreak of measles
 
 ---------------------------------------
 
 Public health authorities are warning Victorians to be on alert as measles spreads through the community at a scale that hasn't been seen in more than a decade. Of the 23 measles cases recorded in Victoria so far this year [2025], almost half were transmitted locally.
 
 
 
 The highly contagious viral illness often causes cold and flu symptoms, a fever, and a red, blotchy rash. In some cases, measles can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia and brain inflammation.
 
 
 
 ""Of the first 20-odd cases, around 9 ended up in hospital, which is quite serious,"" Victoria's Chief Health Officer Dr Tarun Weeramanthri said.
 
 
 
 In the USA, 2 Texas children have died from the disease in 2025 after vaccination rates dropped in the country. Health officials fear Australia could be at risk of the same fate as vaccination rates fall, with fewer than 91 per cent of children fully immunized.
 
 
 
 ""Very regrettably, a few children do die, and we just don't want to see that in Victoria,"" Weeramanthri said.
 
 
 
 In Victoria, the disease is typically brought into the country by returning overseas travellers after Australia eliminated the illness in 2014.
 
 
 
 In 2021, local cases again dropped to zero. This year [2025], cases have already surpassed the previous year's total of 16.
 
 
 
 There are now 15 active exposure sites across Victoria, including Fitzroy, Collingwood, and Cockatoo. The last known exposure site was at Kilmore District Hospital Urgent Care Centre on Wed 23 Apr 2025.

 Texas health officials confirm 18 measles cases in Upshur County, including 5 residents
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
 The Texas Department of State Health Services on Friday [25 Apr 2025] confirmed there are 18 cases of the measles in Upshur County, including 5 who are confirmed residents. In its twice-a-week update, the DSHS said the department is investigating the remaining 13 cases to determine these patients' residency. The agency is also trying to see if these cases are related to the West Texas outbreak.
 
 
 
 Last Friday, 18 Apr [2025], the state health department reported 15 cases in Upshur County with 2 of them being residents. The day before, Upshur County officials reported there were 19 cases at a single location that originated from 2 out-of-state visitors. On 13 Apr [2025], a 19-year-old Upshur County man was treated and released from Christus Good Shepherd Medical Center in Longview, Christus Health and Gregg County Health Authority Dr. Lewis Browne confirmed.
 
 
 
 It is unknown if the patient treated at Good Shepherd is being grouped in with the confirmed people with measles.
 
 
 
 In the West Texas outbreak, officials have reported 646 measles cases. Outside of that outbreak, DSHS has counted 29 cases, including those in Upshur County.

 Austin Public Health (APH) is actively investigating a second reported case of measles in Travis County in 2025.
 
 -------------------------------------------
 
 The case involves a vaccinated adult who may have been exposed to the virus while traveling domestically within the United States. The Travis County resident is currently isolating with mild symptoms.
 
 
 
 ""Two doses of the vaccine will be 97 percent effective in developing immunity to the virus. While a vaccinated person can still get measles, they are more likely to experience mild symptoms and are less likely to spread it,"" said Dr. Desmar Walkes, Austin-Travis County Health Authority. ""We consider measles to be one of the most contagious viruses we know, and getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself. For those who are vaccinated, check with your doctor to see if you may need a booster.""

 *Note: The above exposure list is based on an initial case investigation. More locations may be added. Please check <austintexas.gov/measles> for the latest information.
 
 
 
 1. If you were at one of the venues on the dates and times listed above and are (a) unvaccinated and pregnant, or (b) immunocompromised (receiving treatment that would result in immune system suppression, or have an immune system disease), contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss the possible exposure. If you don't have a provider, call 512-972-5555 and APH can help connect you to care.
 
 
 
 2. Anyone who was at the locations on the dates listed above should monitor themselves for the following measles symptoms through 11 May 2025:
 
 
 
 - fever
 
 - cough
 
 - rash
 
 - red, watery eyes
 
 - runny nose
 
 - small white spots inside the mouth and throat
 
 
 
 3. If you develop symptoms of measles,
 
 - stay home and away from others;
 
 - contact your healthcare provider for guidance;
 
 - call before visiting a clinic or hospital to prevent possible exposure to others.
 
 
 
 ""Beating measles takes all of us buying into vaccinations and getting protected against this vaccine-preventable disease,"" said Austin Mayor Kirk Watson. ""Vaccination helps individuals avoid measles, and higher vaccination rates lower our chances of a local outbreak, protecting children who aren't yet old enough for the vaccine and those individuals who are immunocompromised. Let's stay healthier together.""
 
 
 
 ""The steps are simple: Get vaccinated if you haven't already, stay informed, and look out for one another,"" said Travis County Judge Andy Brown. ""Data from the CDC highlights just how important high vaccination rates are. When a school's vaccination rate drops to 90%, the chance of a measles outbreak rises to 51%. A vaccine is our first line of defense, and it's up to all of us to keep our community safe against this highly contagious and preventable disease.""
 
 
 
 Prevention
 
 -------
 
 The best way to protect yourself from measles is to receive the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are required to receive full protection.

 Measles confirmed in L.A. County resident who recently returned from Texas
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 
 Measles has been confirmed in a Los Angeles County resident who recently returned from Texas, a state that is in the midst of an outbreak of the highly infectious disease, health officials said Friday [25 Apr 2025]. The outbreak in Texas is one of the worst seen in the USA in years, and it has claimed the lives of 2 school-aged children who were unvaccinated and had no underlying medical conditions, according to a report published Thursday [24 Apr 2025] in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
 
 
 
 This is the third measles case reported by the L.A. County Department of Public Health so far this year [2025]. In March, a county resident who had recently traveled through Los Angeles International Airport on a China Airlines flight from Taipei, Taiwan, tested positive. And in February, a case was reported in a non-L.A. County resident who arrived on a Korean Air flight from Seoul.
 
 
 
 ""The traveler was not infectious during the time of travel,"" the county health agency said in a statement Friday [25 Apr 2025] regarding the most recent case.
 
 
 
 Before Friday's announcement, 9 measles cases had been reported in California this year [2025], with cases also reported in Orange, Riverside, Fresno, San Mateo, Placer, and Tuolumne counties, according to the California Department of Public Health. In 2024, California confirmed 15 cases of measles. In 2023, the total was only 4.
 
 
 
 California's worst measles outbreak in recent memory occurred between December 2014 and April 2015. Centered at Disneyland, the outbreak resulted in about 131 Californians getting infected. People from 6 other states, Mexico, and Canada were also sickened, according to the California Department of Public Health.

 Nassau County Department of Health warns of potential hepatitis A exposure
 
 ----------------------------------
 
 The Nassau County Department of Health is announcing a confirmed case of hepatitis A virus in a food handler who worked at Jersey Mike's Subs, located at 24 Atlantic Avenue, Oceanside. Patrons who consumed foods and drinks prepared on-site, or used the restrooms, between 5 and 19 Apr 2025, may have been exposed to hepatitis A. Though the risk of transmission is considered low, out of an abundance of caution, individuals who may have been exposed are advised to speak to their healthcare provider.
 
 
 
 Postexposure treatment is available up to 14 days after exposure. Individuals who are within this window should consult with their healthcare provider and seek treatment as soon as possible. Those outside this window should monitor for symptoms of hepatitis A and consult with their healthcare provider about the potential exposure and the need for vaccination for future protection. Individuals who have received 2 doses of the hepatitis A vaccine or have had the illness in the past are protected and do not require further action.
 
 
 
 Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. Hepatitis A virus may be spread by consuming food or drink that has been handled by an infected person. It may also be spread from person to person by placing something into the mouth that has been contaminated with the stool of a person with hepatitis A.
 
 
 
 The symptoms of hepatitis A may range from mild to severe and include an abrupt onset of fever, fatigue, poor appetite, nausea, stomach pain, dark-colored urine, and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). The disease is rarely fatal, and most people recover in a few weeks without any complications. The symptoms commonly appear within 28 days of exposure, with a range of 15-50 days. There are no special medicines or antibiotics that can be used to treat a person once symptoms appear. Generally, bed rest is all that is needed. Thorough hand washing after bathroom use, and before, during, and after food preparation is the most important means to prevent the spread of this and other intestinal illnesses. Sharing of food and utensils is discouraged especially when anyone is ill.

 Measles - Region of the Americas
 
 --------------------------------
 
 Situation at a glance
 
 ---------------------
 
 As of 18 Apr 2025, a total of 2318 measles cases, including 3 deaths [at least 4 more, from the USA, see below - Mod.LL], have been confirmed in 6 countries in the WHO Region of the Americas, an 11-fold increase compared to the same period in 2024. The majority of cases have occurred among people between 1 to 29 years, who are either unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. Additionally, most cases are imported or linked to importation. Measles is a highly contagious, airborne viral disease that can lead to severe complications and death. Although it is preventable with 2 doses of the vaccine, over 22 million children worldwide did not receive their 1st dose of the vaccine in 2023. This has contributed to a global rise in measles cases in 2024, which heightens the risk of imported infections, particularly from unvaccinated travellers arriving from areas where the virus is actively circulating. WHO is working closely with countries in the WHO Region of the Americas to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles. The regional risk is currently assessed as high, while the global risk remains moderate.
 
 
 
 Description of the situation
 
 ----------------------------
 
 From 1 Jan 2025 to 18 Apr 2025, a total of 2318 measles cases, including 4 deaths, were confirmed in the WHO Region of the Americas, an 11-fold increase compared to the 205 cases of measles reported in the same period in 2024. The cases have been reported from 6 countries: Argentina (n = 21 cases), Belize (n = 2 cases), Brazil (n = 5 cases), Canada (n = 1069 cases), Mexico (n = 421 cases including 1 death), and the USA (n = 800 cases, including 3 deaths).
 
 
 
 Overview by countries
 
 ---------------------
 
 Argentina:
 
 
 
 Between 1 Jan 2025 and 16 Apr 2025, Argentina reported 21 confirmed cases of measles; 10 in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and 11 in Buenos Aires Province. Of these, 3 cases were imported, 13 were identified as contacts linked to the imported cases, and 5 cases are still under investigation to determine their epidemiological link to the transmission chain.
 
 
 
 The index case was reported on 31 Jan 2025, in a child with a history of international travel. The 2nd case, another child and a contact of the index case, was reported on 3 Feb 2025. Neither of the 2 cases had a history of measles vaccination, and both were laboratory-confirmed by RT-PCR. Following these initial cases, 19 additional cases were confirmed up to 16 Apr 2025, with ages ranging from 5 months to 40 years. Two of these cases had a documented history of international travel. Only 2 cases required hospitalization due to pneumonia; the remaining cases were managed on an outpatient basis and are recovering well. Twelve of the cases were confirmed at the National Reference Laboratory of INEI-ANLIS ""Carlos G. Malbr√°n,"" with genotype B3 identified. One of the imported cases, associated with recent international travel to Thailand, was identified as genotype D8.
 
 
 
 Belize:
 
 
 
 On 12 Apr 2025, the Belize Ministry of Health & Wellness confirmed 2 positive measles cases -- Belize's first since 1991. The cases involved 17-year-old males from the Corozal and Cayo districts with no vaccination history, who travelled to Chihuahua, M√©xico, from 5 Jan 2025 to 31 Mar 2025 to attend a religious gathering. The onset of symptoms occurred on 2-3 Apr 2025. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for both cases and confirmed positive for measles on 12 Apr 2025. Thirteen close contacts who attended the religious gathering in Chihuahua were interviewed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) team and monitored daily for signs and symptoms. Despite significant efforts to increase vaccination coverage, Belize remains below the target range of 92-95%. In 2024, Belize reported a country percentage of 83.9% for the 2nd dose of the MMR vaccine.
 
 
 
 Brazil:
 
 
 
 Between 1 Jan 2025 and 18 Apr 2025, Brazil reported 5 confirmed cases of measles across 4 locations: Federal District (1), Rio de Janeiro (2), Rio Grande do Sul (1), and S√£o Paulo (1). The 2 cases in Rio de Janeiro are children under 1 year of age, both without a history of vaccination. The onset of symptoms was on 28 Feb 2025 and 2 Mar 2025. The cases in the Federal District (symptom onset 1 Mar 2025) and Rio Grande do Sul (symptom onset 6 Apr 2025) are adults with a history of international travel. Additionally, an adult case reported in S√£o Paulo who has a history of vaccination, and no history of international travel was reported with symptom onset on 4 Apr 2025. The source of infection for this case is currently under investigation. 
 
 
 
 Canada:
 
 
 
 Between 1 Jan 2025 and 12 Apr 2025, Canada reported 1069 confirmed and probable cases of measles from 7 provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. These far exceed the 177 confirmed and probable cases reported in 2024, representing the highest annual case count since the country achieved measles elimination in 1998.
 
 
 
 The majority (83%) of the cases reported in 2025 are linked to a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak occurring among unvaccinated individuals in under-vaccinated communities that sometimes interact with one another. Between 27 Oct 2024 and 12 Apr 2025, 971 cases have been reported in 7 provinces. The outbreak was initiated by an internationally imported case that attended a large gathering in New Brunswick in October 2024, which included attendees from multiple provinces. Most cases associated with this outbreak are either unvaccinated (84%) or have unknown vaccination status (12%). To date, only a small number of outbreak-associated cases have occurred outside the initially affected under-vaccinated communities, with no evidence of significant further spread beyond these communities. 
 
 
 
 Additionally, between 1 Jan 2025 and 12 Apr 2025, small numbers of localized outbreaks have been reported, consisting of 2 or more epidemiologically and/or virologically linked cases. These outbreaks are distinct from the multi-jurisdictional outbreak described above and have been directly related to internationally imported cases. During this same period, 16 measles cases in Canada have been attributed to international travel.
 
 
 
 Mexico:
 
 
 
 Between 1 Jan 2025 and 16 April 2025, Mexico confirmed 421 measles cases: 2 imported, 35 import-related, and 384 under investigation. Cases were reported in Campeche (n = 4), Chihuahua (n = 403, including one death), Oaxaca (n = 4), Quer√©taro (n = 1), Sinaloa (n = 1), Sonora (n = 5), Tamaulipas (n = 2) and Zacatecas (n = 1).
 
 
 
 The 1st confirmed case is an unvaccinated child in Oaxaca with a history of international travel between October 2024 and January 2025. The child arrived in Mexico on 29 Jan 2025 and developed symptoms on 10 Feb 2025. On 14 Feb 2025, the Oaxaca State Public Health Laboratory reported positive RT-PCR and IgM results for measles with genotype B3 identified. Three related cases were later confirmed.
 
 
 
 On 20 Feb 2025, the 2nd confirmed case was reported in the State of Chihuahua in an unvaccinated child. The onset of symptoms was on 11 Feb 2025, and measles was confirmed by the Chihuahua State Public Health Laboratory with positive RT-PCR and IgM results. The identified genotype was D8. Following contact tracing and active case searches, 419 additional cases were identified.
 
 
 
 The majority of cases were among those aged 25-44 years, accounting for 34.4% (n = 145), followed by children aged 5-9 years (13.5%, n = 57). In terms of vaccination history, 92.4% (n = 389) had no vaccination history, while 3.8% (n =16) had received one dose of the MMR vaccine, and another 3.8% (n =16) had received 2 doses.
 
 
 
 United States of America:
 
 
 
 As of 17 Apr 2025, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases were reported by 25 jurisdictions: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York State, New York City, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas (including 2 confirmed deaths), Vermont, and Washington. Of the total cases, 93% (n = 751) are associated with outbreaks (defined as 3 or more cases), with 10 outbreaks identified so far this year. The outbreak in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma accounts for 82% of the reported cases.
 
 
 
 Children under the age of 5 accounted for 31% (n = 249) of cases, individuals aged 5-19 for 38% (n = 304), adults over 20 for 29% (n = 231), and age was unknown for 2% (n = 16). The vast majority (96%) of the cases were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, 1% had a single dose of the MMR vaccine, and 2% had received 2 doses. Hospitalization was required in 11% of total cases (n = 85 of 800). Among children under 5, 19% (47 of 249) required hospitalization. MMR vaccination coverage in children has decreased in recent years from 95.2% in 2019-2020 to 92.7% in 2023-2024.
 
 
 
 Epidemiology

 Measles is a highly contagious acute viral disease that affects individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children worldwide. The disease is airborne, transmitted through the air or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons.
 
 
 
 Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-14 days after infection, include high fever, rash usually accompanied by a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough and tiny white spots inside the mouth. The rash appears 2-4 days after the onset of fever and spreads from the head to the trunk to the lower extremities. A person is infectious about 4 days before and up to 4 days after the rash appears. While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, most people recover within 2-3 weeks.
 
 
 
 Measles is usually a mild or moderately severe disease. However, measles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, secondary ear infection, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), blindness, and death. Postinfectious encephalitis can occur approximately in about 1 in every 1000 infected persons. Measles also produces immune amnesia; a pathological process that makes the immune system forget how to protect against infections and leaves the infected individual more vulnerable to other infections.
 
 
 
 The measles vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines available. A 2-dose schedule is 97% effective in preventing measles for life. 
 
 
 
 Following the declaration of measles elimination in the Americas Region in 2016, there was an unusual and consistent increase in confirmed cases of the disease from 2017 to 2019. In 2019, the region recorded its highest incidence rate at 21.5 cases per million population. This increase was largely due to large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil, which led to the reestablishment of endemic measles transmission and the loss of elimination status in these countries. Between 2018 and 2023, the Americas Region reported 49 187 confirmed cases in 18 countries, resulting from the importation of viruses from other regions of the world and the resurgence of endemic transmission in Venezuela and Brazil. The last endemic case of measles in the Americas Region was reported by Brazil in June 2022. By 2024, 465 confirmed cases were registered, all either imported or related to importation. That same year [2024], the elimination of the endemic disease in the Americas Region was reverified.
 
 
 
 Public health response
 
 ----------------------
 
 Regional and National Public Health Authorities in the Americas Region are implementing public health measures to control the outbreak, and WHO is providing support by:
 
 - Issuing epidemiological alerts and updates due to the increase in measles cases in several countries in the WHO Region of the Americas that started in 2024.
 
 - Issuing the Public Health Risk Assessment related to measles in the region of the Americas, classified the risk as ""High"", especially in countries with low vaccination coverage.
 
 - Continuing to monitor the situation and work closely with countries in the Region of the Americas to support their vaccination, surveillance and rapid outbreak response efforts to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles and to protect the health of the entire population.
 
 - Providing technical assistance and follow-up with laboratories in
 
 countries that have had cases/outbreaks.
 
 - Strengthening countries' rapid response capacities by 1) training healthcare workers in rapid response to outbreaks, using hybrid workshops and virtual courses; 2) providing financial funds for international consultants' deployment in the most affected areas in LAC; 3) having virtual follow-up meetings with countries.
 
 - Promoting mass follow-up vaccination campaigns in countries with highly susceptible populations to rapidly reduce the risk of the reintroduction of endemic measles and rubella in the countries of the Region.
 
 - Enhancing risk communication and community engagement in countries where outbreaks have occurred, to reinforce their commitment to immunization and recommended actions.
 
 
 
 WHO risk assessment
 
 -------------------
 
 In the WHO Region of the Americas, in 2025, there is an 11-fold increase in the number of cases compared to the same period in 2024. Although an improvement has been achieved in measles rubella surveillance indicators, there are still countries that do not meet the minimum notification rate of 2 suspected cases per 100 000 population, in addition to other indicators, in a homogeneous way. This could delay detection, notification, confirmation, and rapid response actions.
 
 
 
 Difficulty in maintaining adequate levels of vaccination in the migrant population, vaccine-hesitant groups and other at-risk populations within the Region are big challenges. Given that several countries in Europe, Central Asia and Africa have areas of circulation of the virus, the identification of imported cases from these areas is expected. Intense migration from areas where the disease is endemic to areas where it is not could increase the risk of new outbreaks and cases. Considering population movement, international travel and mass gathering events, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out. Travellers from regions with ongoing outbreaks can introduce the virus into countries with higher vaccination coverage, where there are still vulnerable populations, particularly infants who may not yet have received their 1st dose of the measles vaccine.
 
 
 
 The overall risk of measles in the Americas Region is considered high due to several factors:
 
 - Ongoing virus circulation from imported cases has led to outbreaks with extended transmission chains, secondary cases, and virus spread to new areas and countries in 2025.
 
 - Suboptimal vaccination coverage persists across the region. In 2023, only 28.6% of countries achieved over 95% coverage for the 1st MMR dose (MMR1), and just 16.7% for the 2nd dose (MMR2). Regional coverage was 87% for MMR1 and 76% for MMR2. Data for 2024 is still being consolidated.
 
 - An increasing number of susceptible individuals due to continued low coverage, driven by factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitancy, and limited access to healthcare, especially among vulnerable groups such as migrants, displaced persons, and Indigenous populations.
 
 - The overall risk of this event in the WHO Region of the Americas, especially in countries with low vaccination coverage, is classified as high with a high confidence level based on available information.
 
 
 
 The overall risk at the global level is assessed as moderate due to the ongoing transmission in all the other WHO Regions, where immunization programs in several countries are not at an optimal level due to various factors, such as resource limitations, vaccine hesitancy, political instability, and health system weaknesses. These challenges have resulted in gaps in vaccination coverage, leading to widening pockets of the unvaccinated population and creating a pathway for measles to spread. This not only poses a public health concern for affected countries but also represents a potential risk for other regions due to international travel and population movement. The global risk of transmission remains a threat and particularly in areas with moderate or low vaccine coverage and could lead to new outbreaks in an unvaccinated population. This risk, coupled with gaps in laboratory systems and surveillance, outbreak detection and rapid response capacity, impedes progress towards global measles elimination goals and further exacerbates the threat of spread.
 
 
 
 WHO advice
 
 ----------
 
 WHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the 1st and 2nd doses of the measles-containing vaccine (MCV) and strengthening integrated epidemiological surveillance of measles and rubella to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases in public and private healthcare facilities.
 
 
 
 WHO recommends strengthening epidemiological surveillance and preparedness and rapid response capacities in high-traffic border areas to rapidly detect and respond to suspected measles cases. Providing a rapid response to imported measles cases to avoid the re-establishment of endemic transmission through the activation of rapid response teams trained for this purpose and by implementing rapid response protocols when there are imported cases. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national, sub-national and local levels must be ensured, with continuous and effective communication channels across all levels. During outbreaks, it is recommended to establish adequate hospital case management and infection prevention and control capacity to avoid healthcare-associated infection transmission, with appropriate referral of patients to airborne infection isolation rooms (for any level of care) and avoiding contact with other patients in waiting rooms and/or other hospital rooms.
 
 
 
 WHO recommends providing broad access to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) or measles and rubella (MR) vaccination to maintain high vaccination rates of the general population and to ensure individuals at high risk of exposure are up to date on this vaccination, such as health and care personnel and international travellers. Individuals living in outbreak areas should follow local public health guidance. Globally, between 2000 and 2023, vaccination successfully prevented an estimated 60 million deaths (6 million deaths in the Americas) and decreased an estimated measles death from 800 062 in 2000 to 107 500 in 2023, which is an 87% decrease.
 
 
 
 WHO recommends maintaining a stock of the MR and/or MMR vaccines, and syringes/supplies for responding to imported cases. Facilitating access to vaccination services according to the national scheme to incoming and outgoing international travellers, including individuals due to perform activities, domestically or abroad, in areas with ongoing measles outbreaks, displaced populations, indigenous populations, or other vulnerable populations.
 
 
 
 WHO advises international travellers to check and update their vaccination status against measles prior to departure. Unvaccinated individuals from areas experiencing measles outbreaks, with knowledge of exposure to measles cases and/or presenting signs and symptoms compatible with measles virus infection, should consult local health authorities before undertaking an international voyage. At present, no additional measures that significantly interfere with international traffic are warranted.

 Measles cases in Europe skyrocket
 
 ---------------------------
 
 Measles cases across Europe were up 10-fold in 2024 compared to 2023, according to updates today [28 Apr 2025] from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Moreover, the ECDC said the 2024 measles cases in the European region followed a seasonal pattern, which was not noted in 2021 through 2023. In 2024, a total of 35 212 measles cases were reported across the European region, compared to 3973 in 2023.
 
 
 
 About 87% of the European cases were reported in Romania, which had the highest notification rate, at 1610.7 cases per 1 million population, followed by Austria (59.5), Belgium (44.9) and Ireland (39.6).
 
 
 
 Twenty-three measles-related deaths were confirmed in 2024, of which 22 were in Romania, and 14 of the 23 were in children aged 5 years or younger. Children under the age of 1 year represented 13% of measles cases, and children 1 to 4 years represented 33.1% of cases. Among the 90% of case-patients with known vaccine status, 87% were unvaccinated, and 98% of infected babies (younger than 1 year) and 90% of children 1 and 4 years old with measles were unvaccinated. 
 
 
 
 The ECDC said dropping vaccine rates are contributing to the post-pandemic spike in measles activity across the [continent]: In 2024, only 3 countries, Hungary, Malta, Portugal, had coverage of 95% or more for both doses of the measles vaccine.
 
 
 
 Most cases in 2024 in the European region were reported in February through July, with a decline in the second half of the year. ""The marked resurgence in 2024 emphasizes a return to more typical measles seasonal patterns, but at significantly elevated levels compared to the pandemic and pre-pandemic years,"" the ECDC said.

 As Measles Cases Surge, Mexico Issues a US Travel Alert
 
 -------------------------------------------------
 
 As the United States struggles to contain its worst measles outbreak in years, cases have spilled over into Mexico. In an April 25 [2025] report, Mexico's Ministry of Health reported there have been 583 confirmed cases in the country this year, with 560 recorded in the border state of Chihuahua. On April 27 [2025], the Chihuahua Health Secretariat pushed the state's number of confirmed cases even higher, to 713. In comparison, the Pan American Health Organization reported only 7 confirmed cases in the whole of Mexico in 2024.
 
 
 
 The outbreak in Chihuahua is partly due to its proximity to Texas, which it borders to the north. A major outbreak has been ongoing in the US state since late January 2025, and cases in Mexico have been linked to those north of the border. The United States has recorded 884 confirmed cases of measles this year, up from 285 in 2024, as well as 3 deaths from the disease. Of this year's cases in the United States, 646 have been in Texas.
 
 
 
 To try to prevent the measles virus from spreading further throughout Mexico, its Ministry of Health has issued a travel warning for the United States and Canada (<https://tinyurl.com/mr3y556b>), where cases have also risen sharply. The ministry advises travelers to make sure they are up-to-date with their vaccinations, practice social distancing, wear a mask, and frequently wash their hands.
 
 
 
 Falling vaccination levels have also helped drive up Mexico's cases, as they have in the United States. In 98% of US cases this year [2025], the patient -- whether an adult or child -- had no history of vaccination against measles. In early April 2025, it was reported that a 31-year-old man unvaccinated against measles had died of the disease in Chihuahua.
 
 
 
 Because measles is highly contagious, very high rates of vaccination against it -- 95% -- are needed across communities to stop the virus from spreading. But rates of vaccination in Mexico have been faltering. Children are supposed to receive 2 doses of the measles vaccine, the first typically between 12 and 15 months, and the second within the next few years. According to the WHO, in 2023 only 76% of children under 2 years old in Mexico had received a measles vaccine.
 
 
 
 In response to the urgent need to reverse Mexico's decreasing vaccination coverage, the Ministry of Health has launched a National Vaccination Week, the country's first nationwide immunization campaign since the COVID-19 pandemic. From April 26 to May 3 [2025], the plan is to boost vaccine levels in the group most vulnerable to measles: children from 1 to 9 years of age. The ministry hopes to inoculate 1.8 million children to bring them up-to-date with their shots, by offering vaccines free of charge at hospitals, clinics, schools, and health centers.

 8 cases of measles have been diagnosed in Israel in past week, says health ministry
 
 -----------------------------------------
 
 The Health Ministry reports 8 cases of measles from the Tel Aviv and Bnei Brak region, Emek Hefer and Modiin Illit, which have been diagnosed since April 20 [2025], with 6 of the cases in unvaccinated patients. According to the epidemiological investigation, 4 of the patients contracted the disease abroad or through contact with people who had recently returned from abroad. The investigation regarding the other cases is ongoing.
 
 
 
 The ministry emphasizes that anyone who has been in contact with a measles patient should continue testing and vaccinating according to its guidelines. It also recommends that unvaccinated pregnant women, immunosuppressed individuals, and infants who may have been exposed to a measles patient consult with their healthcare providers to determine whether ""passive immunization"" against measles is possible and makes sense for them. The ministry also recommends checking vaccination status and getting vaccinated before traveling abroad, especially to countries known to have significant measles outbreaks.
 
 
 
 Measles is a highly contagious viral disease characterized by fever, general malaise, runny nose and a rash, and it can cause serious and even life-threatening complications.

 The province of M√°laga has recorded a total of 39 cases of measles so far in 2025, 7 more than last week, compared to a total of 67 recorded in Andalusia so far in 2025, the Regional Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs reported today [30 Apr 2025].
 
 
 
 This week, a new outbreak was declared at La Axarqu√≠a Hospital in V√©lez-M√°laga, consisting of one confirmed case imported from Morocco and 2 probable cases, pending confirmation, who are the healthcare professionals who treated the infected person in the hospital's emergency room.
 
 
 
 The province currently has 3 outbreaks under surveillance. In addition to the 2 from last week, the one in V√©lez will almost certainly join the 2 positive cases of the healthcare workers.
 
 
 
 In view of this, the regional government has published the new Measles Surveillance and Alert Protocol, on which it had been working for more than 2 months. Among other new features, this protocol establishes that health centers will review the susceptibility to measles of their staff, even in the absence of suspected cases, and will update their vaccination schedules. The objective of this measure is to avoid contagion among staff who can attend to a suspected case that arrives at the consultation or hospital emergency room.
 
 
 
 The Directorate-General for Public Health and Pharmaceutical Regulation has also updated the section on the use of polyvalent immunoglobulin for contacts and, for outbreak control, plans to advance the second dose starting at 15 months of age for all children awaiting completion of the MMR regimen among residents of the affected area, as well as actively recruiting the susceptible population or implementing other control measures, depending on the magnitude and risk of the outbreak spreading.
 
 
 
 Since the beginning of the year [2025], 67 confirmed cases of measles have been declared in Andalusia, which is 9 more than last week: 4 corresponding to a family outbreak in Malaga, which were pending confirmation, all adults; 3 cases imported from Morocco (one in Almeria and 2 in Malaga), also in adults; the case of a 45-year-old woman from Malaga, from an unknown source; and a case in Seville in a 13-month-old child with a history of vaccination 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms. This case is pending the genotype to determine if it is a post-vaccination measles.
 
 
 
 Therefore, in 2025, 11 outbreaks in total have been declared to date, of which 6 are still active and another 5 have already been declared closed. Thus, Malaga has a family outbreak with 3 confirmed cases from an unknown source, declared on 18 Mar; a more recent outbreak, declared on 14 Apr, with the 4 cases confirmed this week in the same family; in addition to the outbreak declared in the health field, specifically in the La Axarqu√≠a Hospital in Malaga, declared on 29 Apr.
 
 
 
 In recent weeks, the incidence of confirmed cases has shown a downward trend. In addition, for 8 weeks, the cases have occurred only in adults, mainly between 26 and 47 years old, except for the case of the 13-month-old child from Seville, who is suspected of being post-vaccinated. Most of these cases are imported from Morocco, are related to imported cases or associated with an outbreak, with isolated cases from unknown sources greatly decreasing (2 cases in the last 6 weeks). Active outbreaks at this time are familial outbreaks in adults with a small number of cases and usually with 2 generations of cases.
 
 
 
 Health and Consumer Affairs recalls, as confirmed by the registered data, that measles is an infection that is easily transmitted, can be severe, and can affect both unvaccinated children and adults. For this reason, it recommends the vaccination of minors in the established guidelines and of adults who are not aware of being vaccinated to protect those people who cannot be vaccinated (children under 12 months, who represent 14% of the cases reported in Andalusia).
 
 
 
 The epidemiological situation surrounding Andalusia, especially Morocco, which has been experiencing a major outbreak of measles since October 2023 and has spread throughout the country with more than 40 000 reported cases, including 150 deaths; 3012 cases in 15 European Union countries as of 15 Apr (Romania has 5104, followed by the Netherlands with 251 and France with 180; Spain accounted for 179); 712 confirmed cases in the United States, with 2 deaths, as of 10 Apr; and 731 [cases] in Canada as of 11 Apr; as well as the presence of potentially significant pockets of susceptibility in some districts and the seasonality of measles (spring), suggest further outbreaks in the coming weeks and months. The Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs will offer a weekly report on Tuesdays with updated data.

 Measles in Cook County: Two cases confirmed, here's what we know
 
 -------------------------
 
 Two adults -- one in Chicago and one in suburban Cook County -- have been diagnosed with measles, marking the first confirmed cases in the county this year [2025]. According to public health officials, the Chicago case involves an adult who had traveled internationally through O'Hare Airport earlier in April [2025]. That person had received one dose of the MMR vaccine and developed a rash on 25 Apr. They have been isolating at home since diagnosis. The suburban case involves an adult whose vaccination status is unknown. That person sought medical care on 28 Apr and was quickly isolated at a hospital.
 
 
 
 The Cook County and Chicago health departments, along with the Illinois Department of Public Health, are investigating both cases and working to notify people who may have been exposed. Officials have identified several possible exposure locations, including the following:
 
 
 
 21 Apr: Chicago Public Library - Independence Branch (4024 N. Elston Ave.) and Fittingly Delicious (3939 W. Irving Park Rd.)
 
 22-23 Apr: O'Hare Airport, 10 a.m.-8 p.m., especially Terminal 1
 
 25 Apr: Aldi in Lyons (7235 39th St.), 10 a.m.-12:30 p.m.
 
 27 Apr: Shell gas station in Stickney (3901 S. Harlem Ave.), 10 a.m.-12:30 p.m.
 
 28 Apr: Mobil gas station in Berwyn (2945 S. Harlem Ave.), 10:20 a.m.-1 p.m.
 
 
 
 People who were at these locations during the times listed should monitor themselves for symptoms, which could take up to 21 days to develop. Health officials say the best protection against measles is 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, which is about 97% effective. The first dose is typically given between 12-15 months of age and the second between 4-6 years old.
 
 
 
 Free vaccinations are available at Chicago Department of Public Health clinics, and appointments can be made through <getvaxchi.chicago.gov>. Suburban Cook County residents can call 833-308-1988 to schedule a vaccination.
 
 
 
 Dr. Sameer Vohra, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said in a statement that ""being fully immunized remains the best and most effective way for everyone to protect themselves and those they love.""
 
 
 
 The state's new Measles Outbreak Simulator Dashboard helps parents and schools assess vaccination coverage at individual schools, part of a broader effort to prepare for potential outbreaks.
 
 
 
 Chicago and Cook County's health departments will continue tracing contacts and monitoring the situation. Residents who may have been exposed should stay alert for symptoms and call their healthcare provider before seeking medical care if symptoms develop.

 Officials confirm measles case in Defiance County
 
 --------------------------------------------
 
 A measles case has been confirmed in Defiance County, according to the health department. DCHD says this is an isolated case of an adult with an unknown vaccination status. The patient has recovered, but officials are working with the Ohio Department of Health to identify and notify anyone who may have been exposed.
 
 
 
 Measles is very contagious and spreads easily through the air when someone sneezes or coughs. The virus can last in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person has left the area. According to DCHD, symptoms begin 7 to 14 days after exposure and can sometimes take up to 21 days to appear. Symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, and a rash that appears 3 to 5 days after other symptoms.

 Flanders sees rapid rise in measles cases
 
 -----------------------------------
 
 In April [2025], 48 cases of measles were reported in Flanders, the Flemish Department of Public Health reported in a press release. That's more than in the first 3 months of 2025 combined. In the first 4 months of 2025, a total of 95 measles cases were registered in Flanders. The hotspot is the province of Antwerp with 60 cases, of which 47 were unvaccinated, and the main victims are children aged 0-9 years.
 
 
 
 ""We see that in Antwerp, and especially in the city of Antwerp, the number of measles cases continues to increase,"" says Joris Moonens, spokesman for the Department of Public Health. ""We expected this: measles is a very contagious disease that can spread quickly in families and groups where not everyone has been vaccinated.""
 
 
 
 The number of cases in April [2025] is the highest since March 2011, when 60 cases were recorded in Flanders. With 95 cases recorded this year, the region is already approaching the record number of 123 cases in 2024.
 
 
 
 Measles is one of the most infectious viruses. Those infected can suffer from high fever, cough, sore eyes and rash. In extreme cases, the disease can be fatal. About half of the cases in Antwerp resulted in hospitalisation, with some ending up in intensive care.
 
 
 
 The Department of Public Health stresses the importance of increasing vaccination rates to prevent further spread. ""To this end, we are working with a vaccination strategy in which we try to reach as many unvaccinated people as possible in cooperation with general practitioners and hospitals in the Antwerp area,"" Moonens added.

 Las autoridades sanitarias canadienses informaron este jueves de que un brote de sarampi√≥n que afecta a la provincia de Ontario se ha acelerado con 223 nuevos casos en una semana desde que se detect√≥ en octubre de 2024.
 
 
 
 La ministra de Sanidad de Ontario, Sylvia Jones, declar√≥ en una rueda de prensa que la provincia, la m√°s poblada del pa√≠s, ya tiene registrados mil 242 casos de sarampi√≥n a fecha del 29 de abril.
 
 
 
 Ontario no es la √∫nica provincia afectada. En Alberta se han detectado otros 170 casos, mientras que en Quebec la cifra es 36.
 
 
 
 En total, Canad√° tiene mil 479 casos activos, lo que supone el peor brote de sarampi√≥n en el pa√≠s desde hace m√°s de tres d√©cadas. En comparaci√≥n, Estados Unidos tiene registrados unos 900 casos en todo el pa√≠s.
 
 
 
 El incremento de 223 casos en una semana es la mayor cifra desde octubre del a√±o pasado y se produce a pesar de que las autoridades sanitarias de la provincia han iniciado una campa√±a de concienciaci√≥n sobre la necesidad de vacunar a los ni√±os.
 
 
 
 Ontario tambi√©n confirm√≥ este jueves los primeros casos de sarampi√≥n en la capital canadiense, Ottawa. Las autoridades creen que los dos afectados, un adulto y un ni√±o, adquirieron la enfermedad durante un viaje al extranjero.

 2025 Measles Outbreak Guidance
 
 ------------------------------
 
 Overview
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.
 
 
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 Reports
 
 The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles originating in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is highly contagious, additional cases are likely to occur. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays by noon Mountain Standard Time if there are new cases to report.

 Measles Outbreak May 2, 2025
 
 --------------------------
 
 The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is reporting an outbreak of measles primarily in West Texas. At this time, 683 cases have been confirmed since late January 2025. This is an increase of 20 since the April 29 [2025] update. One percent, or fewer than 10 of the confirmed cases, are estimated to be actively infectious since their rash onset date was less than a week ago. Individuals are infectious 4 days prior to and 4 days after rash onset.
 
 
 
 [A total of] 89 of the patients have been hospitalized. This number is the total number of people hospitalized over the course of the outbreak. It is not the current number of people in the hospital. Tuesday's [29 Apr 2025] report included 23 additional hospitalizations from earlier in the outbreak. The numbers may increase as DSHS receives records for earlier cases.
 
 
 
 There have been 2 fatalities in school-aged children who lived in the outbreak area. The children were not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.
 
 
 
 Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities.
 
 
 
 Based on the most recent data, DSHS has identified designated outbreak counties with ongoing measles transmission: Cochran, Dallam, Dawson, Gaines, Garza, Lynn, Lamar, Lubbock, Terry and Yoakum. DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak. We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.

Whooping cough cases remain high across Louisiana
------------------------------------------
Mirroring national trends, the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) is reporting an increase in whooping cough (pertussis) cases that could result in a record high for 2025 -- more than has been seen annually in the state for at least 35 years. The Department has identified 164 cases in the first 4 months of 2025. In comparison, Louisiana had a total of 153 cases in 2024. Pertussis is a naturally occurring disease in the United States and Louisiana with predictable increases in reported cases every few years.

The significant spread of whooping cough is leading to a corresponding increase in reported hospitalizations and deaths. Since September 2024, 40 people in Louisiana have been hospitalized with whooping cough. Seventy percent of those hospitalizations have occurred among babies younger than 1 year old. Sadly, 2 deaths have occurred among young infants hospitalized with whooping cough. These were the first whooping cough deaths reported in Louisiana since 2018.

Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_. People with whooping cough commonly have severe coughing fits. This causes them to take deep breaths right after coughing, making a ""whooping"" sound. It spreads from person to person through coughing, sneezing, and close contact. Infected people can spread the bacteria from the start of symptoms and for up to 3 weeks after coughing begins.

Infants under the age of 1 year are most affected by whooping cough, showing the highest reported rates of infection and the greatest likelihood of severe complications and death, although the disease can occur in anyone. The bacteria that cause whooping cough are often unknowingly spread to infants by close family or caregivers.

Recommendations for the general public
- Review your and your child's immunization history to see if you are up to date on your pertussis-containing vaccines. Talk to your provider if you have any questions about the pertussis vaccine.
- Routine prevention steps, including hand washing and covering your mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing, are essential to prevent the spread of bacteria.
- Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and do not share food, utensils, toothbrushes, cigarettes, or similar personal items.
- If you think you or your child has pertussis, isolate yourself from others and call your healthcare provider before arriving so they can prepare for your arrival without exposing people.
- If you think you have been exposed to someone with pertussis, contact your healthcare provider about medication that can keep you from getting sick.

Protecting young babies
- Infants are not eligible to receive a pertussis-containing vaccine until they are 2 months old, which can leave young babies at particularly high risk for severe disease.
- The best way to protect newborns from whooping cough is for pregnant women to receive a Tdap vaccine during each pregnancy. Other individuals who may have close contact with young babies should talk to their healthcare provider about their vaccine history and whether they should receive a pertussis vaccine.

About the pertussis vaccines
Vaccination is the best way to prevent serious complications. The vaccines are effective, but protection fades over time.

Two vaccines help protect against whooping cough: DTaP for children younger than 7 years and Tdap for older children, teens, and adults. Both also protect against tetanus and diphtheria.

- Babies and children younger than 7 years old should receive DTaP vaccine a total of 5 times, at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years.
- Preteens should receive the Tdap booster between 11 and 12 years.
- Adults should receive another dose of Tdap every 10 years.
- Pregnant women should also get the Tdap vaccine during the third trimester of any pregnancy. Evidence shows that infants are less likely to develop pertussis early in life if their mother received the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy.

Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about the DTaP or Tdap vaccines and if they are right for you.

 Jaundice has reared its head in another place
 
 ---------------------------------------------
 
 A hepatitis A outbreak has occurred in the Prievidza region of Slovakia, specifically in the care facility in Nitrianske Pravno. A total of 16 cases were reported at the institution, including the priest who regularly celebrates Mass and the head nurse who was hospitalized. The authorities took immediate measures: the home was sealed off, visitors were banned, and continuous, meticulous disinfection is being carried out.
 
 
 
 The outbreak likely started among the homeless community in Privigye, among whom the infection has been spreading for months. In their case, treating the infection is particularly difficult, as many do not visit a local doctor and their contacts are difficult to trace.
 
 
 
 Milo≈° Panovƒç√≠k, head of the emergency department at the Bojnice hospital, said that there is no infectious diseases clinic in Privigenƒõ, so all patients are treated in one place.
 
 
 
 In order to contain the epidemic, authorities are considering deploying mobile vaccination teams to deliver vaccinations directly to affected communities. Those who refuse to be vaccinated could be placed in a 50-day quarantine. Local governments are also taking part in prevention: they are disinfecting schools and public areas and providing hand sanitizers.

La ciudad de FlorianÃ³polis, capital del estado de Santa Catarina en el sur de Brasil, declarÃ³ un estado de emergencia sanitaria por un perÃ­odo inicial de 180 dÃ­as ante el aumento acelerado de casos de sÃ­ndrome respiratorio agudo grave (SRAG), una condiciÃ³n clÃ­nica que puede ser provocada por distintos virus como la gripe o el virus sincitial respiratorio (VSR).

La medida fue oficializada mediante un decreto publicado el 1Â° de mayo de 2025 y tendrÃ¡ una vigencia inicial de 180 dÃ­as, con posibilidad de prÃ³rroga. SegÃºn informaron autoridades locales, el brote saturÃ³ la infraestructura hospitalaria, especialmente las unidades de cuidados intensivos (UCI), que muestran niveles crÃ­ticos de ocupaciÃ³n en Ã¡reas pediÃ¡tricas, neonatales y de adultos. El incremento de internaciones graves generÃ³ hacinamiento y redujo la capacidad de respuesta del sistema de salud, una situaciÃ³n que las autoridades consideran alarmante.

Desde enero de 2025 se registraron mÃ¡s de 400 casos confirmados de SRAG en el municipio, una cifra considerada elevada si se tiene en cuenta que FlorianÃ³polis cuenta con una poblaciÃ³n estimada de 537.000 habitantes. El virus afectÃ³ especialmente a niÃ±os pequeÃ±os y adultos mayores, considerados los sectores mÃ¡s frÃ¡giles frente a infecciones respiratorias agudas.

El SRAG, una enfermedad frecuentemente causada por una serie de virus respiratorios, tales como la influencia o el virus sincitial respiratorio (VSR). Tras el aumento de casos, los hospitales locales estÃ¡n al borde del colapso, especialmente las unidades de cuidados intensivos. Este incremento en los casos graves ha llevado al sistema a una sobrecarga, disminuyendo la capacidad de respuesta en un clima que las autoridades han calificado como ""alarmante"".

El decreto habilita una serie de acciones orientadas a reforzar el sistema sanitario y contener la propagaciÃ³n del virus:

-ContrataciÃ³n de personal sanitario: se permitirÃ¡ incorporar mÃ©dicos, enfermeros, tÃ©cnicos y otros profesionales de forma temporal y urgente.
-ExtensiÃ³n de la jornada laboral: el personal en funciones podrÃ¡ ser convocado a extender sus turnos, bajo regulaciones laborales vigentes.
-Compras directas: se autoriza la adquisiciÃ³n de medicamentos, insumos y equipos sin necesidad de procesos de licitaciÃ³n, para agilizar la respuesta.

Las autoridades sanitarias municipales informaron que se continuarÃ¡ con un monitoreo constante de la evoluciÃ³n de los casos en hospitales y centros de atenciÃ³n primaria. AdemÃ¡s, se prevÃ© el refuerzo de campaÃ±as de vacunaciÃ³n contra la gripe y el impulso al uso voluntario de mascarillas en espacios cerrados o concurridos.

TambiÃ©n se prevÃ© que en los prÃ³ximos dÃ­as se intensifiquen campaÃ±as de vacunaciÃ³n, especialmente contra la gripe, y se promueva el uso de mascarillas en espacios cerrados o con aglomeraciÃ³n de personas.

AdemÃ¡s, no se descarta la posibilidad de adoptar nuevas medidas restrictivas o preventivas si la situaciÃ³n se agrava, como la suspensiÃ³n de clases presenciales en escuelas, restricciones a eventos pÃºblicos o cambios en el funcionamiento del comercio.

 Possible measles exposure in major Missouri metro
 
 -------------------------------------
 
 A few weeks after Missouri's first known case of measles this year [2025], another possible exposure was reported in a major metro area. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services announced that a person confirmed to have measles visited the St. Louis Aquarium between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. 30 Apr [2025]. They also ate at a restaurant on that same day, but other details are limited. The visitor was from out of the state.
 
 
 
 Measles is highly contagious, so those who may have been exposed at the aquarium and are unvaccinated or immunocompromised are asked to consider post-exposure prophylaxis, or preventive measures to fight off a disease. They would have until 6 May for the prophylaxis to be effective. Anyone who has been exposed to measles should be monitoring any possible symptoms for 21 days. Symptoms generally appear 7 to 14 days after exposure.
 
 
 
 Measles can be transmitted from direct contact with droplets or through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. It is so contagious that an infected person can ""easily"" pass the virus to 9 out of 10 people around them who are unvaccinated or don't have natural immunity, the DHSS said. The virus can remain in the air and on surfaces for 2 hours after the infected person leaves the area, the DHSS said.

 North Dakota confirms first measles case since 2011
 
 ----------------------------------------------
 
 The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services has confirmed the state's first measles case since 2011. A Williams County child who was not vaccinated is believed to have contracted the illness from an out-of-state visitor, the department said Friday [2 May 2025]. The child is in isolation at home.
 
 
 
 Health officials are contacting people who may have had contact with the child and advising people who are not vaccinated to quarantine. The threat to the public is low due to a majority of North Dakotans being vaccinated against the disease, according to the department.
 
 
 
 Molly Howell, immunization director for HHS, said vaccination is the most effective defense against contracting measles.
 
 
 
 ""Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination is safer than risking measles illness,"" Howell said. ""The MMR vaccine has been safely used in the United States since 1973.""
 
 
 
 Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, and eye irritation followed by a body-wide rash.
 
 
 
 ""Anyone with symptoms consistent with measles should call ahead before visiting a clinic to avoid exposing others,"" she said.
 
 
 
 The department said there is no specific medical treatment for measles, but antibiotics may be used in cases that have developed a secondary bacterial infection. People who were vaccinated as children and adults born before 1957 are considered protected.
 
 
 
 The department said 2 doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing infection. The vaccine is recommended for children at 12-15 months and a booster between 4-6 years old. The department also recommends that families and individuals consult with their health-care provider to discuss immunizations. North Dakota has an 81% MMR vaccination rate among toddlers, and a 90% rate among kindergarten students for the 2024-2025 school year. According to public health data, a 95% vaccination rate is generally needed to prevent wider spread in communities.

 A community leader in the area and a director with the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Abdulazeez Suleiman, who disclosed this, also raised an alarm over the development.
 
 
 
 Suleiman lamented that the 2 children were lost within 48 hours after exhibiting symptoms such as sore throat, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and debilitating weakness.
 
 
 
 ""The outbreak in Tukur-Tukur serves as a reminder of the fragility of our public health achievements.

 ""The recurrence of diphtheria in Tukur-Tukur raises critical questions about the state of our public health infrastructure, vaccination coverage, and community awareness.
 
 
 
 ""The cyclical nature of such outbreaks often unveils underlying systemic issues, including inadequate access to healthcare, vaccine hesitancy, and insufficient community engagement,"" he said.
 
 
 
 He averred that the cooperation of parents with health workers is paramount in combating this resurgence, urging parents to recognise the importance of vaccination and seek immediate medical attention for any symptoms indicative of diphtheria or other communicable diseases.
 
 
 
 ""The role of health authorities in this scenario cannot be overstated. A swift and robust response is imperative to contain the outbreak and prevent further loss of life.
 
 
 
 ""Mobilising healthcare professionals to Tukur-Tukur must be prioritised, ensuring that vaccinations are administered, public awareness campaigns are launched, and treatment facilities are adequately equipped to handle potential cases,"" he said.
 
 
 
 Suleiman further advocated the need for collaboration between local health officials, international organisations such as WHO and UNICEF, and community leaders as vital for effective response.
 
 
 
 He further stressed that government must invest in strengthening healthcare infrastructure in underserved areas, which include availability of vaccines and enhancing the capacity of healthcare facilities to manage outbreaks effectively.
 
 
 
 ""Training healthcare workers in the recognition and treatment of diphtheria, alongside establishing surveillance systems to monitor disease trends, is vital for early detection and response,"" he stated.

 Hepatitis A is now considered to be causing an outbreak in Los Angeles County
 
 -------------------------------------------------------
 
 After a rise in cases throughout 2024, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is declaring an outbreak of hepatitis A. According to public health, hepatitis A cases tripled from 2023 to 2024, with 165 cases reported in the county in 2024. As many as 29 have been reported in 2025 so far.
 
 
 
 Hepatitis A is found in the stool of infected persons and is transmitted through the fecal-oral route. It can be spread through close person-to-person contact and through contaminated food or drink, public health warns. Because of its transmission methods, hepatitis A is especially prevalent among unhoused people as they have less access to sanitation like handwashing and toilets.
 
 
 
 Public health recommends residents make sure they're sanitizing, and to check if they're vaccinated against hepatitis A. ""The ongoing increase in hepatitis A cases signals that quick action is needed to protect public health,"" said Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County health officer. ""The hepatitis A vaccine is safe, effective, and offers long-term protection. Getting vaccinated is simple, and it's one of the most important things you can do for your own health and the health of our entire community. It is also important for residents to wash their hands with soap and water regularly and especially before eating and preparing food and after using the bathroom.""

<https://www.radiookapi.net/2025/08/07/actualite/sante/alerte-aux-cas-de-paralysie-flasque-aigue-moba>


Cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have been reported in recent days in Moba Territory, Tanganyika Province. The information was confirmed on Thursday, 7 Aug 2025, by the Chief Medical Officer of the Moba Health Zone, Dr. Barwine Moma, during an interview with Radio Okapi.

Biological samples were collected from the patients and sent to Kinshasa for analysis, Dr. Moma said. These tests will determine whether the cases are linked to poliomyelitis, a serious viral disease that can cause irreversible paralysis.

""Any nerve damage can lead to flaccid paralysis. There are also polio cases that cause this type of paralysis. When a child who used to walk can no longer walk, we must consider this a suspected case,"" explained Dr. Moma.

Cases mistaken for malnutrition
-------------------------------
Some time ago, 2 cases in children were reported in Moba Port. However, after investigation, it was found that their paralysis was due to severe malnutrition and delayed psychomotor development, not poliomyelitis. The doctor stressed the importance of not drawing hasty conclusions without biological confirmation.

The best way to protect against this disease is vaccination. A polio catch-up vaccination session was recently organized in the Moba Port health area, targeting children who had received no doses or had been missed during the last campaign.

Although rare, acute flaccid paralysis is closely monitored by health authorities because of its potential link to the poliovirus. While awaiting the results of the analyses, vigilance remains essential in the Moba region.

 Alberta ramps up measles vaccination push as 3 children in intensive care
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Alberta's government says 3 children are in intensive care in hospital after contracting measles. A health ministry spokesperson declined to disclose their ages, citing privacy concerns. At a news conference Monday [5 May 2025], Dr. Sunil Sookram, Alberta's interim chief medical officer of health, said there have been no deaths.
 
 
 
 Sookram said the risk of getting the highly contagious disease in Alberta is at its greatest point in almost 30 years. He was appointed to the role last month [April 2025] after the province's former top public health official declined to stay on when his contract ended. ""Up until now we thought the disease had been eradicated, but things have changed,"" said Sookram. ""Measles is now circulating in several areas in our province, and it's quite concerning.""
 
 
 
 Alberta reported 55 new case, bringing the provincial total to 265 since the beginning of March [2025]. The majority of confirmed cases are in children, with 77 of those under 5. Alberta Health Services also issued an alert warning that an individual who was contagious recently attended the south Edmonton Cineplex Odeon movie theatre. The health authority said anyone who attended the theatre on 26 Apr 2025 between 8:30 p.m. and 1 a.m. and who hasn't received 2 doses of the measles vaccine is at risk.
 
 
 
 Health Minister Adriana LaGrange announced that the government will be launching a vaccination campaign featuring advertising in a variety of formats and languages, as well as a measles hotline. ""The campaign is simple: 'Don't get measles. Get immunized,'"" she said, adding that the government is also looking to provide daycares with information for parents.
 
 
 
 LaGrange said the government's existing social media advertising campaign encouraging Albertans to check their vaccination status has been a success, but ""we realize we need to do more. Our hope is that this awareness campaign increases immunization rates and makes sure that Albertans have the access to information that they require as well,"" LaGrange said. ""Getting immunized against measles is the single most important thing you can do to protect your loved ones and yourself and your community.""
 
 
 
 LaGrange said close to 90% of the confirmed cases this year [2025] involve people who weren't vaccinated. The government's vaccine push is also to include expanded clinic hours in Alberta's central and south zones, which Sookram said have seen almost 80% of the cases, including all but 4 of the new ones reported Monday [5 May 2025].
 
 
 
 Dr. Ifeoma Achebe, the central zone's medical officer of health, said measles vaccination rates need to reach 95% to prevent a more widespread outbreak. Vaccination rates in communities in her area range from 72 to 90%, she said. 
 
 
 
 LaGrange said the government has responded to the situation as needed over the past 2 months. ""It's just as more is needed, more has to be done,"" she said.
 
 
 
 Measles symptoms include fever, coughing, a runny nose, red eyes and a blotchy, red rash that appears 3 to 7 days after the fever starts.

48 children die from whooping cough; 809 cases identified
---------------------------------------------------------
Health Secretary David Kershenobich reported 809 confirmed cases of whooping cough (pertussis) and the deaths of 48 children under 1 year of age.

The deaths have been recorded in 15 entities.

There have been 7 deaths in Jalisco, and 7 in Mexico City. Five deaths have each occurred in the State of Mexico, Chihuahua, and Chiapas. 

Three deaths were reported in Aguascalientes, and 2 deaths have been recorded in each of the following states: Coahuila, Nuevo LeÃ³n, Tamaulipas, San Luis PotosÃ­, Puebla, Veracruz, and Campeche. In Oaxaca and YucatÃ¡n there was 1 death in each of them.

Kershenobich said the children who died did not receive the vaccine, because it is first given at 1 year of age. Therefore, she urged pregnant women starting at week 20 to get the pertussis vaccine so that immunity can be passed on to their children and they will be protected.

""Of those 809 cases, we have unfortunately had 48 deaths in children under 1 year of age. This is very important from an epidemiological perspective because if we go to the next slide, we see the vaccination schedule, and in the vaccination schedule, the 1st vaccine is given at 1 year of age. All of these children who have died are under 1 year of age,"" the Secretary explained.

""The very important thing we want to convey is that pregnant women starting at week 20 should receive the vaccine because that way immunity is passed on to their children, protecting them.""

""So, the particular risk group we're focusing on, in addition to children, is specifically pregnant women in their 20th week of pregnancy, whether or not they have previously received the whooping cough vaccine.""

The official reported that children die from bronchial spasms during coughing attacks.

El ministro de Salud PÃºblica, Edgar Lama, confirmÃ³ a PRIMICIAS este 5 de mayo de 2025 que Ecuador registra 11 fallecimientos a causa de la tosferina en lo que va del aÃ±o. La mayorÃ­a de los decesos, dijo, corresponden a niÃ±os menores de cinco aÃ±os, siendo los reciÃ©n nacidos los mÃ¡s afectados.

Durante la entrevista, Lama detallÃ³ que 321 casos de tosferina se han reportado oficialmente hasta la semana epidemiolÃ³gica actual. Aunque esa cifra se informa desde la semana anterior.

Tosferina en Ecuador: quÃ© es, cÃ³mo se contagia y quÃ© medidas tomar para prevenir la enfermedad
Las provincias mÃ¡s afectadas son Guayas, Pichincha, ManabÃ­ y Santo Domingo, donde ya se han desplegado brigadas de vacunaciÃ³n para contener la propagaciÃ³n de esta enfermedad altamente contagiosa.

â€œTosferina es una enfermedad bacteriana que se contagia por la tos y por las micropartÃ­culas que quedan en el aire (...) Lamentablemente, tenemos 11 fallecimientos, de los cuales seis son menores de cinco aÃ±os. La mayor parte son reciÃ©n nacidosâ€.

Edgar Lama, ministro de Salud, seÃ±alÃ³ que una de las principales causas del incremento de casos es la disminuciÃ³n en el cumplimiento del esquema de vacunaciÃ³n infantil.

Si bien la mayorÃ­a de los padres cumple con las tres primeras dosis de la vacuna pentavalente (a los 2, 4 y 6 meses), se ha detectado un preocupante descenso en la aplicaciÃ³n de los refuerzos, que deben colocarse al aÃ±o y medio y a los cinco aÃ±os.

Ante la situaciÃ³n, el Ministerio de Salud ha modificado el esquema de vacunaciÃ³n, adelantando las dosis a los 2, 3 y 4 meses, con el objetivo de ofrecer una protecciÃ³n mÃ¡s temprana.  AdemÃ¡s, se ha intensificado la vacunaciÃ³n de mujeres embarazadas, para que los bebÃ©s nazcan con cierto grado de inmunidad.

El Ministro tambiÃ©n hizo un llamado a los padres de familia para que envÃ­en a sus hijos a clases usando mascarilla, como medida preventiva, y recordÃ³ que las escuelas serÃ¡n puntos clave para ejecutar una vacunaciÃ³n masiva en niÃ±os.

â€œUno de los grandes problemas por los que ha crecido la tosferina en el paÃ­s es porque muchos padres han dejado de vacunar a sus hijos con los refuerzosâ€.


En una nota previa publicada por este medio, ya se habÃ­a alertado sobre el aumento sostenido de casos de tosferina, que actualmente registran 321 contagios, mientras que, en todo el 2024, fueron 141 casos reportados.
 
Esto coincide con una caÃ­da en las coberturas de vacunaciÃ³n infantil, que apenas superaban el 70% en algunas provincias, muy por debajo del 95% recomendado por la OrganizaciÃ³n Mundial de la Salud.

El Ministerio de Salud asegurÃ³ que mantiene activos los cercos epidemiolÃ³gicos y continÃºa con las campaÃ±as de informaciÃ³n y vacunaciÃ³n, principalmente en zonas urbanas y escolares, con el objetivo de frenar la expansiÃ³n de esta enfermedad que, aunque prevenible, puede ser letal si no se trata a tiempo.

 Sedgwick County confirms measles case in unvaccinated child. It's the first since 2017
 
 --------------------------------------------
 
 Sedgwick County health officials have confirmed the area's first case of measles in 8 years, officials announced in a Wednesday [7 May 2025] morning press release. The virus was identified in a child between the ages of 5 and 10 who is unvaccinated, the press release states. The health department is working on identifying the source of exposure, and said the agency would notify those who may have been exposed.
 
 
 
 ""We urge residents to review their vaccination status and consult their healthcare provider if they have symptoms such as fever, cough, or rash,"" health department director Adrienne Byrne said in the press release.
 
 
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus spread through the air. An infected individual usually won't see symptoms until about 10 to 14 days after exposure, according to Mayo Clinic, and they are contagious 4 days before and after symptoms begin and end. Measles symptoms include a fever, cough, sore throat, and a runny nose, as well as a rash that begins on the face and moves to the neck, chest, and back. It can also reach the arms and legs.
 
 
 
 Historically during an outbreak, one in 5 people who contract the virus need hospital care, Byrne said in an April [2025] interview with The Eagle. In severe cases, people with measles can eventually develop pneumonia.
 
 
 
 The Sedgwick County case joins the other 46 confirmed measles cases in Kansas, a number last updated 30 Apr [2025], according to a Kansas Department of Health and Environment dashboard. There was a total of 935 confirmed measles cases nationwide as of 1 May [2025], according to the CDC.
 
 
 
 The last measles case reported in the county was in 2017.
 
 
 
 ""Measles remains one of the most contagious diseases, with the potential for serious complications,"" Byrne said in the press release. ""The best way to prevent measles is by getting vaccinated. Protect children by making sure they have the MMR vaccine.""
 
 
 
 The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective at protecting individuals from contracting measles. During an outbreak, children as young as 6 months living in the area can get the first dose of the vaccine.

 5 more cases of measles found in western North Dakota, bringing state total to 9
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 An additional 5 measles cases have been identified in Williams County, bringing North Dakota's 2025 total to 9 cases. According to North Dakota Health and Human Services, all the newly confirmed individuals were unvaccinated and had no reported contact with previously identified cases. These individuals are currently isolating at home as recommended to help limit further spread, a release said.
 
 
 
 The first measles case in North Dakota since 2011 was identified in Williston on 2 May [2025]. The case appeared in an unvaccinated child in Williams County who authorities believe contracted the disease from an out-of-state visitor. On Mon 5 May [2025], officials confirmed the total had jumped to 4 cases, all identified in unvaccinated individuals.
 
 
 
 Measles is a contagious viral illness that can lead to serious and deadly symptoms in young children and those with compromised immune systems. Symptoms include a fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and a body-wide rash.
 
 
 
 North Dakota health officials said members of the public who were at the Williston Walmart on 29 Apr [2025] between 2 and 5 p.m. may have been exposed. Anyone who was at the store at that time is encouraged to monitor for symptoms and contact a health-care provider if symptoms develop.
 
 
 
 Four of the people diagnosed with measles were in Williston schools while infectious, state health officials said. North Dakota Century Code requires unvaccinated students to be excluded from school for 21 days following exposure. Staff at the schools without documentation of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination or who were not born before 1957 should also not attend school, officials said.
 
 
 
 Unvaccinated staff and children in the following schools have been told to remain at home and monitor for symptoms:
 
 
 
 Missouri Ridge Elementary: 7-23 May
 
 Williston Middle School: 7-21 May
 
 Williston High School: 7-21 May
 
 
 
 ""Due to the current measles outbreak, please isolate at home if you have symptoms of runny nose, fever, cough, and rash,"" Beverly Tong, Upper Missouri District Health Unit deputy director, said in the release. ""Isolation should continue until at least 4 full days after the onset of a rash. Time from exposure to onset of rash is generally around 7 to 21 days, and you can spread measles up to 4 days prior to the time the rash appears.""
 
 
 
 Tong recommended contacting a primary doctor for anyone who wishes to be tested for measles.
 
 
 
 Officials said the new cases are not linked to earlier known exposures. However, as a precaution, state officials recommend all residents and travelers to Williams County ensure they are vaccinated against measles. This includes consideration of early MMR vaccination for infants aged 6 through 11 months. Infants younger than 6 months are not eligible for the vaccine.
 
 
 
 Aside from the single case in 2011, North Dakota had not had any reported measles infections since before 2000, when the disease was eliminated from the USA, according to the CDC.
 
 
 
 MMR vaccination rates declined in North Dakota kindergartners from 95% in 2019-2020 to 90% this school year [2024-2025], the North Dakota News Cooperative reported.

 2 Yellowknife schools close due to measles exposure
 
 ------------------------------------------------
 
 Yellowknife's Catholic school board has temporarily closed 2 of its schools because of a case of measles. The school board sent a notice Sunday night [4 May 2025] to Weledeh Catholic School and √âcole St. Patrick High School parents. It says the closure is a precaution while they determine if enough staff have proof of vaccination to continue operating.
 
 
 
 The letter follows another from the NWT chief public health officer (CPHO) forwarded to parents over the weekend. It warned them that children at those schools might have been exposed to measles during the school day on 28 Apr, 30 Apr, and 1 May 2025. A similar letter was sent to parents with children at Yellowknife District No. 1's Sir John Franklin High School. It says students there might have been exposed to a case of measles on 2 May [2025] between 2:05 and 4 p.m.
 
 
 
 The CPHO named other potential exposure locations in a news release on Monday [5 May 2025] afternoon. These include Breakaway Fitness on 27 Apr, between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m.; the downtown Tim Hortons on 28 Apr, between 11 a.m. and 1:40 p.m.; and Range Lake School gymnasium and atrium on 28 Apr, between 4 and 6 p.m. The news release says this past weekend's Super Soccer event is not considered an exposure location ""at this time.""
 
 
 
 The CPHO sent out public notices earlier this spring, warning that measles was spreading in other parts of the country, and encouraging people to check their immunization records and get vaccinated.
 
 
 
 It says people who have had 2 shots of a measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine are very unlikely to catch it, but that measles is one of the most easily transmissible infections. It's spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Symptoms include a dry cough, runny nose and sore throat, and a blotchy rash that usually starts on the face.
 
 
 
 The notice to families at Sir John states that students with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine can go to school; those who received that vaccine outside the territory are required to email a copy of the immunization records to Yellowknife Public Health at <ykphschools@gov.nt.ca>.
 
 
 
 Yellowknife Catholic Schools said it will issue an update Monday [5 May 2025] afternoon on its school closures.

 De una semana a la otra los casos de sarampi√≥n no paran de crecer, algo que los expertos atribuyen a que hay gente que ha dejado de vacunarse, problema que involucra tambi√©n a otras enfermedades. El parte oficial que acaba de conocerse indica que ya son 26 los casos de esta enfermedad a nivel nacional, de los cu√°les 11 se concentran en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, y 14 en el Conurbano, geograf√≠a a la que ahora se sum√≥ la provincia de San Luis con el contagio de una beba de 8 meses.
 
 
 
 En la Ciudad los casos se focalizan sobre todo en Palermo (comuna 14). Seg√∫n datos proporcionados por el Bolet√≠n Epidemiol√≥gico Nacional (BEN), siete de los 11 casos est√°n relacionados con los dos primeros contagios importados detectados en febrero de este a√±o, ya sea por v√≠nculo directo -cinco de los casos residen en un mismo edificio- o por transmisi√≥n comunitaria ocurrida en la zona o en una sala de espera hospitalaria.
 
 
 
  El problema del sarampi√≥n, adem√°s de los s√≠ntomas que provoca la enfermedad y las eventuales complicaciones que puede traer el cuadro, es que se trata de una infecci√≥n extremadamente contagiosa. Alguien que ha contra√≠do el virus puede transmitirlo en un radio de influencia cercano -y en un breve lapso- a entre 8 y 12 personas.
 
 
 
 El brote ya ha excedido la zona de Palermo, donde comenz√≥ el primer foco. ‚ÄúDe acuerdo con la investigaci√≥n epidemiol√≥gica, los otros casos pertenecen a la comuna 1 (N. de la R: integrada por Retiro, San Nicol√°s, Puerto Madero, San Telmo, Montserrat y Constituci√≥n), comuna 4 (N: de la R: La Boca, Barracas, Parque Patricios y Nueva Pompeya) y comuna 12 (N de la R: Coghlan, Saavedra, Villa Urquiza y Villa Pueyrred√≥n)‚Äù, se√±al√≥ el BEN.
 
 
 
 Dos de los casos porte√±os confirmados no cuentan con v√≠nculo comprobado con el resto: ‚ÄúNo se pudo obtener secuencias gen√≥micas para establecer alg√∫n v√≠nculo con las cadenas de transmisi√≥n conocidas relacionadas a la importaci√≥n‚Äù, detalla el informe oficial. El virus de sarampi√≥n, que este a√±o viene teniendo una circulaci√≥n mayor a los anteriores.
 
 
 
 En la provincia de Buenos Aires, ocho de los 14 casos confirmados presentan v√≠nculos epidemiol√≥gicos claros con los detectados en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires. Otro caso presenta antecedente de viaje a Tailandia, ‚Äúcon genotipificaci√≥n que descarta relaci√≥n epidemiol√≥gica con el resto de los casos‚Äù. Esto complejiza el escenario porque ‚Äúplantea una nueva cadena de transmisi√≥n‚Äù, alerta el BEN.
 
 
 
 Adem√°s, en cuatro de los contagios, a√∫n no ha sido posible determinar el nexo con las cadenas de transmisi√≥n conocidas relacionadas a la importaci√≥n. ‚ÄúEn uno de los casos que se encontraba en investigaci√≥n, el nexo con los casos confirmados se determin√≥ genotipo B3, por lo que podr√≠a estar relacionado con la cadena de transmisi√≥n de los casos importados‚Äù.
 
 
 
 La mayor cantidad de casos del Conurbano est√° concentrada en Florencio Varela, pero tambi√©n fueron confirmados contagios en Berazategui, Guernica, Quilmes, Moreno, Adrogu√©, Avellaneda y La Matanza. Explicaron que ‚Äúla vigilancia epidemiol√≥gica se mantiene en curso para identificar contactos, intentar cortar las cadenas de transmisi√≥n y minimizar la dispersi√≥n del virus‚Äù.
 
 
 
 Mientras tanto, en la provincia de San Luis se registr√≥ el primer caso del pa√≠s fuera del √°rea metropolitana de Buenos Aires: ‚ÄúSe ha confirmado un caso importado en una beba de ocho meses, que no contaba con vacunaci√≥n para el evento por no corresponder por la edad. Presenta antecedente de viaje a M√©xico, al Estado de Chihuahua‚Äù, se inform√≥.
 
 
 
 El documento que difunde el Ministerio de Salud afirma que ‚Äúresulta fundamental garantizar el cumplimiento del esquema de vacunaci√≥n contra el sarampi√≥n de acuerdo a las recomendaciones vigentes en los establecimientos con actividades educativas, deportivas, recreativas y sociales"".
 
 
 
 Y agrega que ""las aulas y otros espacios donde se desarrollan las actividades mencionadas suponen el contacto estrecho entre ni√±os, adolescentes y adultos, la convocatoria a reuniones y actos escolares con gran afluencia de personas y un incremento del desplazamiento de la poblaci√≥n, constituyendo as√≠ un escenario que facilita la propagaci√≥n del virus del sarampi√≥n en la comunidad‚Äù.

 North Dakota confirms 3 new measles cases, bringing total to 4
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 
 North Dakota now has 4 confirmed measles cases, the Department of Health and Human Services said Monday [5 May 2025]. All 4 cases are in Williams County in northwest North Dakota involving people who were not vaccinated, said Molly Howell, immunization director for the department.
 
 
 
 The department announced Friday [2 May 2025] the 1st confirmed case, a Williams County child who is believed to have contracted measles from an out-of-state visitor. The 3 additional cases are people who had contact with the child, Howell said. The cases are the first reemergence of measles in North Dakota since 2011, Howell said.
 
 
 
 A North Dakotan tested positive for measles in 2018, but after additional testing, the department confirmed that person did not have the illness, Howell said. ""Our advice to anyone in North Dakota is to be up to date with your immunizations, especially the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine,"" Howell said. ""Everyone starting at 12 to 15 months of age should receive their 1st dose of MMR vaccine and the 2nd dose is recommended at 4 to 6 years of age.""
 
 
 
 Howell said infant vaccination rates in North Dakota are at about 81% and school-aged children have about a 90% rate, but those rates differ depending on location. She added there are no immediate plans to roll out mobile vaccination clinics because the vaccines are readily available at local health care providers. ""It's more concerning in areas where there are lower vaccination rates, so ideally, we're hoping parents have a conversation with their trusted health care provider,"" she said. 
 
 
 
 With measles being a highly contagious illness, Howell said a 95% vaccination rate is recommended to contain the spread of the disease locally. Howell said North Dakota public health agencies did lose some COVID-19 pandemic-related funding from the federal government in recent weeks, but she doesn't believe the cuts will affect the state's ability to respond to the measles cases. ""We'll continue to ensure that North Dakotans across the state have access to MMR vaccines, and other vaccines,"" she said.
 
 
 
 Howell said people should not downplay the seriousness of measles, but she did not want people to panic either. ""What we want is for people to be informed of the benefits of vaccination versus the risks of the disease,"" she said. ""We used to have 5000 to 6000 cases per year before the vaccine was available, but people died and were hospitalized. And now we have a way to prevent it and there's no reason for anyone to have to deal with this terrible disease."" Howell said the department will continue to update its measles-dedicated website as more information becomes available.

 IDPH: Measles cases up to 6, including 4 in southern Ill.
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
 The Illinois Department of Public Health reports the number of measles cases in the state is up to 6, including 4 in southern Illinois.
 
 
 
 According to the department, 2 new cases in southern Illinois were confirmed over the weekend, adding to 2 in the Marion area that were identified in April [2025].
 
 
 
 Two unrelated cases were previously confirmed in Cook County.
 
 
 
 According to IDPH, 1 of the new cases over the weekend is in the Franklin-Williamson Bi-County area. 
 
 
 
 They say this now meets the technical CDC definition of an ""outbreak"" in that area, which is when 3 or more cases are linked to one another. They say social links between the 3 cases are known.
 
 
 
 Another southern Illinois case may have visited locations in Missouri, including the St. Louis Aquarium.
 
 
 
 ""The risk to the general public from measles remains low,"" IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra said in a news release. ""The key to preventing measles is the highly effective MMR vaccine. Two doses are 97% effective in preventing this serious infection. I recommend that our Illinois residents make sure they and their family members are up to date on the MMR vaccine and all other age-appropriate immunizations.""
 
 
 
 Shawnna Rhine with the Southern Seven Health Department says if you are unsure if your measles vaccine is up to date, here's what you can do.
 
 
 
 ""Well, there's a very easy blood test to determine your immune level, so if it's been since the early 1960s that you know that you have been vaccinated, it is good to go ahead and talk with your doctor and make sure that you are still fully immune. If not, you can get a booster from your local health department to put you back in immune status.""

Ecuador registers 11 deaths from whooping cough so far in 2025, most of them are newborns
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Minister of Public Health, Edgar Lama, confirmed to PRIMICIAS on 5 May 2025 that Ecuador has registered 11 deaths due to pertussis (whooping cough) so far in 2025. Most of the deaths, he said, correspond to children under 5 years of age, with newborns being the most affected. During the interview, Lama explained that 321 cases of whooping cough have been officially reported as of the current epidemiological week. However, that figure has been reported since the previous week.

The most affected provinces are Guayas, Pichincha, ManabÃ­ and Santo Domingo, where vaccination brigades have already been deployed to contain the spread of this highly contagious disease. ""Whooping cough is a bacterial disease that is spread by coughing and by the microparticles that remain in the air (...) Unfortunately, we have 11 deaths, of which 6 are under 5 years of age. Most of them are newborns."" Edgar Lama, Minister of Health, pointed out that one of the main causes of the increase in cases is the decrease in compliance with the childhood vaccination schedule.

Although most parents comply with the first 3 doses of the pentavalent vaccine (at 2, 4 and 6 months), a worrying decrease in the application of boosters has been detected, which should be given at one and a half and 5 years of age. In view of the situation, the Ministry of Health has modified the vaccination schedule, bringing forward the doses to 2, 3 and 4 months, with the aim of offering earlier protection. In addition, vaccination of pregnant women has been intensified, so that babies are born with a certain degree of immunity.

The Minister also called on parents to send their children to classes wearing a mask, as a preventive measure, and recalled that schools will be key points to carry out mass vaccination in children. ""One of the big problems that has caused whooping cough to grow in the country is because many parents have stopped vaccinating their children with boosters.""

In a previous note published by this media, there had already been an alert about the sustained increase in cases of pertussis, which currently register 321 infections, while, in all of 2024, there were 141 reported cases. This coincides with a drop in childhood vaccination coverage, which barely exceeded 70% in some provinces, well below the 95% recommended by the WHO.

The Ministry of Health assured that it is keeping the epidemiological fences active and continues with information and vaccination campaigns, mainly in urban and school areas, with the aim of stopping the spread of this disease that, although preventable, can be lethal if not treated in time.

 New Mexico health department reports measles spread to 5th county
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 New Mexico health officials on Wednesday [7 May 2025] reported the 1st measles case in Curry County, afflicting an infant, and warned of possible exposures last week at a social services office and Walmart. Additionally, 3 more measles cases emerged in Lea County, bringing New Mexico's case total to 71. Health officials have now diagnosed measles in 5 counties: Chaves, Curry, Do√±a Ana, Eddy and Lea.
 
 
 
 ""Seeing measles in a new county underscores the need to remain vigilant and get vaccinated,"" NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a statement. ""It also serves as a reminder the measles outbreak in New Mexico isn't over. We urge New Mexicans to make sure their vaccination records are up to date.""
 
 
 
 Between 1 Feb and 3 May 2025, 23 706 New Mexicans received a vaccine, nearly double the 2024 rate of 12 985 during the same time frame. Two doses of the vaccine can provide 97% protection against measles infection.
 
 
 
 Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus spread through contact with droplets from an infected person talking, coughs or sneezes. Symptoms can take 1 to 3 weeks to appear, and people can spread measles before showing a fever, red eyes, cough, headache or the spotty red rash.
 
 
 
 Health officials said people at the following locations may be exposed to measles:
 
 
 
 30 Apr 2025, from 10:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., at the WIC Agency, 1216 Cameo St. in Clovis.
 
 30 Apr 2025, from 11:30 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. at Walmart, 3728 N. Prince Street in Clovis.
 
 4 May 2025, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Firehouse Subs, 3734 N. Grimes Street., Suite. A in Hobbs.
 
 4 May 2025 from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. at Bob's Thriftway, 904 Avenue D in Lovington.
 
 
 
 The current United States measles outbreak is the worst in 30 years, with cases reported in 30 of the 50 states and in Canada and Mexico. Across New Mexico, school nurses say they remain on alert for measles cases, while working to build trust with parents about vaccinations.
 
 
 
 After the outbreak first began in mid-February 2025, one of the first things Desiree Smith, a school nurse in Portales for the past 15 years, did was reach out to parents of unvaccinated children.
 
 
 
 ""We wanted to let them know the process if their child was exposed, or has the measles,"" Smith said, noting that the latest guidance from NMDOH is for unvaccinated children to not attend school for 21 days from the last exposure. She said depending on the district, plans would need to be in place for remote learning during that period. We did have a couple of parents who had their children vaccinated after I explained the dangers of measles, obviously, the exposure time and time away from the classroom.""
 
 
 
 School nurses in New Mexico are responsible for reviewing students' vaccine records, which are required by state law to be up to date. New Mexico, unlike other states, does not allow for ""personal or philosophical exemptions,"" but does allow for religious or medical exemptions, which must be updated every year.
 
 
 
 Smith, who is also the director of the New Mexico School Nurse Association, said educational health providers are both potential first responders to an outbreak and play a crucial role in addressing the falling vaccine rates furthering spread.
 
 ""Since COVID we have had we have seen a lot more vaccine hesitancy,"" Smith said.
 
 
 
 According to NMDOH data, New Mexico exemption rates are rising. Taos County has the highest exemption percentage at 3.35%, followed by De Baca County at 2.96% of students and Harding County in 3rd at 2.70%.
 
 
 
 Smith said she and other school nurses received guidance from the state health department in February [2025] to reach out to parents with exemptions, and alert them about the measles outbreak. Smith, who also sits on the board of the National Association of School Nurses, said the larger goal is to keep kids healthy enough for school.
 
 
 
 ""As school nurses, we just want what is best for the children, we're trying to make sure they are safe, healthy and ready to learn and that time out of the classroom is minimized as much as possible,"" she said. ""Vaccination is one of the best ways to do that.""

 Measles outbreak confirmed in Orange County
 
 -------------------------------------------
 
 Orange County health officials confirmed 3 measles cases in children under the age of 5, making New York the 12th state in the USA with a measles outbreak in 2025. An outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases, according to the CDC. There was little information available about the Orange County cases. County officials declined to share specifics, such as the location of the cases or whether the children were vaccinated, citing patient privacy and health regulations.
 
 
 
 In a state Department of Health report released earlier in 2025, Orange County reported the lowest measles vaccination rate in the Capital Region and Mid-Hudson Region -- 64.9% as of 1 Jan 2025, well below the 95% rate needed to provide ""herd immunity."" A figure of 36.2% was reported in the 10950 zip code, which includes the town of Monroe and parts of Kiryas Joel.
 
 
 
 In March [2025], health officials confirmed the state's 1st measles case outside New York City in 2025 in an unvaccinated child from Nassau County.
 
 
 
 Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that's airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines and has been considered eliminated from the USA since 2000. As the virus takes hold in USA communities with low vaccination rates, health experts fear that measles' spread could stretch on for a year.

 Hepatitis A cases increase in Brazil and the risks are very dangerous
 
 -------------------
 
 Since 2023, Brazil has seen a significant increase in hepatitis A cases among adults, which led the Ministry of Health to expand the age range that can access the vaccine against the disease. Traditionally, hepatitis A was more common in children, especially those with poor access to basic sanitation services. However, the evolution of the epidemiological profile of the disease has brought a new concern: the increasing sexual transmission, particularly through anal sex, which has become one of the main forms of contagion. In 2023, approximately 69.5% of [Brazilian] hepatitis A cases were registered in adult men.
 
 
 
 Faced with the change in the hepatitis A profile, the federal government decided to expand vaccination against the disease. Since the beginning of May [2025], the vaccine has been recommended not only for children under 4 years old, but also for users of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a medication that prevents HIV infection. This expansion aims to reduce the number of serious cases and associated complications, such as the need for liver transplants, which has already been observed in some cases.
 
 
 
 The government's goal is to vaccinate 80% of the 120 000 PrEP users in Brazil, with 2 doses administered 6 months apart. In addition, people with chronic liver disease, HIV, immunosuppressive conditions, and transplant recipients already had access to the vaccine free of charge. For other adults, the vaccine is available through the private health system.
 
 
 
 Hepatitis A is caused by a virus that is most often transmitted via the fecal-oral route, although unprotected sexual intercourse also poses a significant risk of infection. The disease may be asymptomatic or may present mild symptoms, such as fatigue, fever, nausea and yellow skin (jaundice). In most cases, the infection is self-limiting and disappears spontaneously within 6 months. However, in certain situations, it can develop into more serious forms, such as fulminant hepatitis, a rare condition that may require a liver transplant.
 
 
 
 Washing your hands frequently, cooking food thoroughly and disinfecting fruits and vegetables are basic and effective measures to prevent contagion. In addition, using condoms and paying attention to the origin of the water you drink, especially when traveling to regions with poor sanitation infrastructure, are fundamental strategies to reduce the risk of infection.

 Germany Diphtheria Outbreak: RKI Issues Urgent Vaccination Warning
 
 ---------
 
 Germany is facing a concerning resurgence of diphtheria, a dangerous infectious disease once thought to be largely eradicated. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany's national public health agency, has issued a warning about a potential nationwide outbreak, urging immediate action to prevent further spread. This alarming situation highlights the importance of vaccination and public health vigilance.
 
 
 
 The RKI's latest epidemiological bulletin reveals a significant increase in diphtheria cases, particularly those linked to the ST574 strain, first identified in Germany during a broader European outbreak in 2022. By April 2025, 126 cases were reported nationwide. This isn't just affecting one group; the RKI's report emphasizes that the disease is spreading beyond initially vulnerable populations like refugees and the homeless, affecting a wider segment of German society.
 
 
 
 The outbreak disproportionately impacts unvaccinated individuals, older adults with pre-existing conditions, drug users, and those experiencing homelessness. The widening reach of the disease signals a concerning change in transmission dynamics. The once-controlled diphtheria is now spreading more broadly within the German population.
 
 
 
 The [bacterium] _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, responsible for diphtheria, produces toxins that can cause severe respiratory issues, heart damage, and nerve problems -- potentially leading to death if left untreated. Symptoms, including fever, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing, can escalate rapidly.
 
 
 
 Historically, diphtheria was a devastating disease, claiming thousands of lives, especially children. The introduction of the diphtheria vaccine in 1913 dramatically reduced infection rates. However, recent years have witnessed a disturbing trend, with the RKI recording 51 confirmed cases in 2024 and 2 more by early 2025.
 
 
 
 This resurgence is largely attributed to declining vaccination rates. Only 64% of 15-month-old children in Germany are fully immunized against diphtheria. This lower-than-ideal rate contributes to the increased risk of outbreaks and severe cases of the disease.
 
 
 
 The RKI has issued several key recommendations to combat the outbreak:
 
 - Increased vaccination: The RKI strongly advocates for vaccination, particularly among at-risk populations. The standard vaccination schedule consists of three doses starting at 2 months of age, followed by booster shots.
 
 - Enhanced surveillance: Healthcare professionals are urged to conduct thorough testing for diphtheria, especially in suspected cases within vulnerable groups.
 
 - Improved diagnostics: Laboratories are advised to utilize PCR diagnostics to detect the diphtheria toxin gene and report any positive findings promptly.
 
 
 
 The RKI has identified 2 genetically linked sub-clusters of cases, one near Frankfurt and another in Berlin, with possible links to neighboring countries, indicating potential cross-border spread. The institute continues to closely monitor the situation.
 
 
 
 The diphtheria outbreak in Germany serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vaccination and ongoing public health vigilance. The RKI's urgent warnings highlight the need for increased vaccination rates, improved surveillance, and prompt medical attention for anyone experiencing potential symptoms. This collective effort is crucial to preventing a wider spread and protecting public health from this potentially fatal disease. Staying informed and ensuring your vaccinations are up to date are vital steps in mitigating the risk.

 The rapid spread of the diphtheria outbreak in the Batha and Barh El Gazal regions has prompted an unprecedented mobilization of health authorities.
 
 
 
 Faced with this potentially fatal disease, the Ministry of Public Health, in collaboration with various partners, is implementing effective strategies to contain the crisis. According to the latest statistics, several cases have been reported in recent weeks, urging medical teams to intensify their efforts.
 
 
 
 A Coordinated Response to the Epidemic
 
 --------------------------------------
 
 Strengthening Knowledge on Diphtheria:
 
 
 
 The first crucial step in combating this outbreak is to enhance the knowledge of key actors across the healthcare chain. Training and information exchange sessions are regularly organized, involving district health officials and community health workers. The aim is to ensure a deep understanding of the symptoms, transmission modes, and preventive measures.
 
 
 
 Case Management Protocols and Epidemiological Surveillance:
 
 
 
 Establishing clear protocols for the treatment of diphtheria cases is also a top priority. Medical teams are provided with specific guidelines that facilitate early diagnosis and appropriate care. Simultaneously, strengthened epidemiological surveillance enables the rapid identification of new cases, ensuring a swift and coordinated response.
 
 
 
 Community Engagement: Advocacy and Awareness:
 
 
 
 The involvement of local opinion leaders plays a key role in raising public awareness. Advocacy meetings are held to encourage these influential figures to inform citizens about preventive measures and the symptoms of diphtheria. This collaborative approach fosters greater community adherence to public health efforts.
 
 
 
 Vaccination: An Essential Tool:
 
 
 
 Vaccination remains one of the most effective ways to control the spread of diphtheria. Intensified immunization campaigns are being rolled out across many villages, focusing particularly on children, who are the most vulnerable. The goal is to achieve a high vaccination coverage rate to prevent any resurgence of the disease.
 
 
 
 Implications for Local and Regional Public Health
 
 -------------------------------------------------
 
 Impact on the Health System:
 
 
 
 Managing this outbreak has significant repercussions on the health system at various levels. Such a crisis can lead to additional costs in terms of care, treatment, and hospitalization. Enhancing the response capacity of healthcare infrastructure has therefore become a pressing priority.
 
 
 
 Collaboration Among Health Stakeholders:
 
 
 
 Fighting diphtheria requires close cooperation between all involved stakeholders. Ongoing communication between the Ministry of Health, non-governmental organizations, and local communities is essential to optimize resources and strengthen awareness efforts.
 
 
 
 Conclusion: What Are the Prospects for the Future?:
 
 
 
 As efforts intensify to fight diphtheria in the Batha and Barh El Gazal regions, it is crucial to maintain a sustained commitment to public health. Current initiatives demonstrate the determination of all stakeholders to bring the outbreak under control and protect vulnerable populations.
 
 
 
 In the short term, tangible results are expected, including a reduction in the number of cases and improved knowledge within communities. In the long term, this crisis could serve as an opportunity to strengthen and sustain local health systems, thereby improving preparedness for future health threats. The coming months will be critical, and continued vigilance will be essential to stay on track and prevent a resurgence of diphtheria.

South Kivu: 187 deaths and more than 4400 cases of measles recorded since January 2025
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One hundred eighty-seven (187) deaths and 4400 confirmed measles cases have been recorded since January 2025 in South Kivu Province, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, ACP learned Saturday [16 Aug 2025] from statistics provided by the provincial health division.

According to figures from the Provincial Health Division (DPS), ""187 deaths and 4498 measles cases have been registered since the beginning of 2025. Of the 34 health zones in the province, 30 are already affected. Kalole health zone is the most impacted, with 833 cases reported since January [2025], followed by Kitutu (702 cases) and Nyangezi (660 cases). In the city of Bukavu, Ibanda commune has already recorded 67 cases, but no deaths,"" the document states.

The situation remains concerning: in the past week, 204 cases and 5 deaths were reported, compared to 230 cases and 10 deaths the previous week. A highly contagious viral disease, measles can cause severe complications and even death. The Provincial Health Division (DPS) is therefore urging parents to ensure that their children receive the 2 recommended vaccine doses: the 1st at 9 months and the 2nd at 15 months.

""Some parents do not take their children to the hospital out of ignorance. If a child is under 24 months and has not received both doses, they can still be vaccinated. Signs of measles include red eyes, tearing, and small skin rashes on the body,"" recalled the communications officer of DPS/South Kivu.

To curb the spread of the epidemic, the DPS, with support from its partners -- including UNICEF, WHO, and the Congolese government -- is currently carrying out awareness campaigns and preparing a vaccination drive in 6 health zones. Medical treatment for measles is free of charge in all state health facilities.

Health authorities are urging the population, especially parents, to vaccinate all children to break the chain of transmission of this life-threatening disease for young children.

 2025 Measles Outbreak Guidance
 
 ------------------------------
 
 Overview
 
 --------
 
 Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.
 
 
 
 The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.
 
 
 
 Reports
 
 -------
 
 The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles originating in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is highly contagious, additional cases are likely to occur.
 
 We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays by noon Mountain Standard Time if there are new cases to report.

 Measles Outbreak - 9 May 2025
 
 -----------------------------
 
 The Texas Department of State Health Services is reporting an outbreak of measles primarily in West Texas.
 
 
 
 - At this time, 709 cases have been confirmed since late January [2025]. This is an increase of 7 since the 6 May 2025 update.
 
 
 
 - Less than 1%, or fewer than 10 of the confirmed cases, are estimated to be actively infectious since their rash onset date was less than a week ago.
 
 
 
 - Individuals are infectious 4 days prior to and 4 days after rash onset.
 
 
 
 Ninety-two of the patients have been hospitalized. This number is the total number of people hospitalized over the course of the outbreak. It is not the current number of people in the hospital. 
 
 
 
 There have been 2 fatalities in school-aged children who lived in the outbreak area. The children were not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.
 
 
 
 Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities.
 
 
 
 Based on the most recent data, DSHS has identified designated outbreak counties with ongoing measles transmission: Cochran, Dallam, Dawson, Gaines, Lamar, Lubbock, Terry and Yoakum. Garza and Lynn counties have been removed from the list of designated outbreak counties because it has been 42 days, or 2 incubation periods, since the last case was infectious.
 
 
 
 DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak.
 
 
 
 We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.

 New measles case in Auckland -- alerts issued over ferries and supermarket
 
 ---------------------------------------------
 
 The person at the centre of a new measles alert in Auckland is a crew member on a Fullers360 ferry, the company has confirmed.
 
 
 
 Alerts have been issued after a new measles case was confirmed today [11 May 2025], with people in Auckland asked to check if they could have been exposed. Health New Zealand said the case was linked to overseas travel, and the person with measles had been at Woolworths Kelston, on Fullers360 ferries, and at an Auckland carpark during the time they could be infectious.
 
 
 
 It was thought the person contracted measles while in Asia; however, at the point they flew back to New Zealand, they had not yet progressed to the infectious stage of the disease, Health NZ said. Both the person with measles and their household were being supported, and some were now in quarantine to help reduce the chance of the disease spreading.
 
 
 
 Fullers360 has confirmed in a statement that it was a crew member. ""Staff who are considered to have been in possible contact with the known case in our crew are being contacted by Health New Zealand and will be guided by them on any further necessary steps.""
 
 
 
 Auckland Transport (AT) spokesperson Blake Crayton-Brown said AT was notified by Fullers early on Sunday [11 May 2025] evening. He said it was unlikely that sailings will be affected on Monday [12 May 2025].
 
 
 
 Crayton-Brown said the Downtown Carpark on Customs Street -- which has also been identified as a location of interest -- is managed by AT. He said they would be talking to staff on Monday [12 May 2025] to identify any staff who may have been exposed. Crayton-Brown said they would also be speaking to HNZ to confirm which parts of the carpark were considered exposure locations on Monday 5 May, as there are several different locations for stairs and lifts in the building. He said AT will be communicating to staff this week about the importance of being vaccinated for measles.
 
 
 
 Measles, one of the most contagious diseases known, can be fatal or cause serious long-term health consequences, particularly for young children. The virus can live in the air long after the infectious person has left. About 10 percent of people who contract it get so sick they need hospital treatment, experts have previously said, and about 90 percent of those who come into contact with it and are not immune are likely to be infected.
 
 
 
 New Zealand's general immunization rates -- and community ""herd protection"" -- have been dropping since the COVID-19 pandemic, with experts recently issuing stark warnings to vaccinate children, as an epidemic could be one plane ride away.
 
 
 
 People who were at [the following] Auckland locations during [certain] times are being asked to check their immunisation status and stay vigilant for symptoms (see below). Anyone not immune to measles, who was at these places, should phone Healthline on 0800 611 116 for advice as they are considered close contacts.
 
 
 
 ""If you are not immune, please stay at home until you have contacted Healthline,"" Health NZ said in a statement.
 
 
 
 - Woolworths Kelston: on 3 May, 2:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. All people who were at the supermarket could have been exposed, Health NZ said.
 
 
 
 - Auckland Downtown Carpark, Custom Street: on 5 May, 1:30 p.m. -2:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. - midnight. Health NZ said the groups they are especially concerned with were people who used the stairs between 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m., or people who were in the lifts between 11 p.m. and midnight.
 
 
 
 Various sailings of the Fullers360 ferries on 5 May [2025] were affected

 Fullers360 ferries sailings 5 May, up to 7:40 p.m.:
 
 
 
 ""Only those who used the toilets on [the following] ferries are close contacts; everyone else should watch for symptoms,"" Health NZ said.

 Health Ministry says 32 cases of measles diagnosed since 20 April [2025]
 
 ------------------------------------
 
 The Health Ministry reports that 32 measles cases have been diagnosed in Israel since 20 Apr [2025]. The diagnosed patients were from Modiin Illit, Emek Hefer, Or Akiva, Bnei Brak, Jerusalem, Baqa al-Gharbiya, Beit Yitzhak, and Rehovot. Of the 32 patients, 26 are not fully vaccinated, and 3 are still under epidemiological investigation.
 
 
 
 After the ministry's call to get vaccinated, there was a 37% increase in vaccinations in places with high morbidity including Modiin Illit, Bnei Brak, and Jerusalem.
 
 
 
 According to the Hebrew news outlet Ynet, the ministry has approached rabbis to enlist their support for the vaccination campaign ahead of the Lag B'Omer celebrations at Mount Meron on 16 May [2025].
 
 
 
 Measles is a highly contagious viral disease characterized by fever, general malaise, runny nose, and a rash, and it can cause serious and even life-threatening complications.

 Hepatitis A is spreading rapidly in the Czech Republic with 6 deaths so far
 
 -------------------------------------------
 
 The Czech Republic is seeing a surge of hepatitis A infections that does not appear to be slowing down. The country recorded 450 cases and 6 deaths from hepatitis A in the first 4 months of 2025, compared with 636 cases and 2 deaths all of 2024.
 
 
 
 But Czech health officials said the actual number of infections is likely much higher because of how difficult it is to track the spread of the virus, which causes liver inflammation that can be fatal in rare cases. ""We know from experience that even one confirmed case can subsequently mean a big problem,"" the State Health Institute (SZ√ö) said in a statement.
 
 
 
 People can be infected after contact with a sick person's stool, for example, via unwashed hands, contaminated food or water, or dirty door handles. Places with poor sanitation and hygiene are the ideal breeding ground for the virus.
 
 
 
 Many infected people do not have symptoms, but about 10% experience serious health problems that can lead to liver failure and death, Czech officials said. Adults aged 50 and older and people who already have chronic liver disease are at higher risk of complications.
 
 
 
 The capital city, Prague, and the surrounding Central Bohemian region, as well as the Moravia-Silesian region bordering Poland and Slovakia, have reported the most hepatitis A cases in 2025. The virus is spreading among children, teenagers, young adults, and people engaged in ""risky behavior,"" officials said. In Prague, for example, nearly 1 in 3 patients are homeless, and many use drugs.
 
 
 
 Health officials encouraged people to get vaccinated against hepatitis A. Two doses taken 6 to 18 months apart can help protect people against infection. Because many infected people are homeless, Czech health workers have distributed the vaccine to shelters for free. People who work closely with drug users and those living on the streets are also being vaccinated in Prague.
 
 
 
 But ""it is very difficult for these people to comply with anti-epidemic measures, and contact tracing is especially problematic,"" making it harder to control the spread of the virus, officials said. In 2024, officials tracked down 6375 contacts of people infected with hepatitis A.

 Belize Health Ministry confirms measles outbreak; urges public to get vaccinated
 
 -------------------------------
 
 The Ministry of Health and Wellness (MOHW) has issued a public health update confirming a measles outbreak in Belize, with 2 lab-confirmed cases and 5 additional clinically diagnosed cases, all linked to one of the initial patients. The ministry has intensified surveillance in the Spanish Lookout area, where suspected cases are under investigation. The cases are believed to be linked to recent travel from Chihuahua, Mexico.
 
 
 
 MOHW is urging individuals who are not vaccinated to avoid traveling to Spanish Lookout. Officials stress that while investigations are ongoing, the full scope of the outbreak is not yet known. The ministry has pledged to keep the public informed as new information becomes available.
 
 
 
 To protect public health, MOHW is encouraging all eligible individuals to get vaccinated. Children should receive 2 doses as part of routine immunization at 12 and 18 months. Unvaccinated individuals over 18 months should get 2 doses a month apart. A booster dose is recommended for anyone who only received one dose, and those unsure of their vaccination status should get one dose as a precaution.
 
 
 
 [Non-immune] travelers 12 months and older should be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before travel. Unvaccinated children under 1 year should consult a healthcare provider.
 
 
 
 The public is advised to act swiftly after potential exposure by getting vaccinated within 3 days and contacting a healthcare provider. MOHW emphasized that while the MMR vaccine is safe and effective, it is not recommended for pregnant individuals, people with severe allergies to previous MMR doses, or those who are immunocompromised.
 
 
 
 The ministry also outlined quarantine measures following exposure: no quarantine for vaccinated individuals, 21 days for unvaccinated individuals, and 14 days for those vaccinated after exposure.

 As a very large and deadly measles epidemic spreads across 4 states in the Great Plains region of the USA, there are concerns that transmission of the measles virus will continue for months. The USA might even lose its measles elimination status if virus transmission persists for 12 months or longer (1). Ironically, this criterion was established by the CDC after the USA first achieved this hard-fought goal in 2000.
 
 
 
 The 2025 USA Great Plains measles epidemic emerged after declines in measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine immunizations in West Texas and adjoining areas, where nonmedical vaccine exemptions for philosophical or religious reasons have steadily increased (2). Almost a decade ago, future measles epidemics were predicted for West Texas and the Texas Panhandle, where this current one began (3). Now, the only way it can be slowed or halted is through catch-up MMR immunization and public relations campaigns.
 
 
 
 If regular measles epidemics become a new normal or if the USA does lose its elimination status, both pediatricians and internal medicine physicians may need to revise some aspects of their MMR immunizations practices. Currently, the CDC and its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommend that children receive their first MMR dose (or MMRV, adding a varicella vaccine) at 12 to 15 months of age, followed by a second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. However, in April 2025, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) modified these recommendations for 10 Texas counties where measles transmission is occurring (4). For young children, these recommendations are similar to those proposed by the WHO in countries where measles cases are widespread (5).
 
 
 
 The changes recommended for West Texas are instructive for both pediatricians and internal medicine physicians who might soon face similar measles epidemics in several areas in the USA.
 
 
 
 The first modification for areas of ongoing measles transmission includes children aged 6 to 11 months receiving an ""outbreak"" or early MMR dose. This change is based on the recognition that maternal antibodies to measles may wane significantly over this period, leaving the infant highly vulnerable to measles infection. Should an infant receive their first dose between 6 and 9 months of age, the WHO recommends that this immunization should be recorded as a ""supplemental dose"" before infants receive 2 additional MMR doses according to the usual schedule (5). In the USA, the CDC recommends a 3-dose measles schedule for any infant who receives their first MMR dose at 6 to 11 months, with the last 2 doses the same as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (6). Three doses may be required because the immune response to MMR before one year of age is not as robust as it is for older children (5). For this current outbreak, the Texas DSHS also recommends that children aged 12 months and older who have already received their first dose of MMR vaccine receive their follow-up dose after 28 days, in other words sooner than 4 to 6 years of age (5).
 
 
 
 At the opposite end of the age spectrum, both the Texas DSHS and CDC do not recommend the MMR vaccine for any adult born before 1957. This assumes that measles transmission was practically ubiquitous in the first half of the 20th century, and virus infection elicits enduring immunity. However, the CDC makes an important exception for health-care personnel who are ""serving a measles outbreak area"" or work in a health-care facility where there is a measles outbreak. For such health-care workers, 2 MMR doses are recommended ""regardless of birth year, who lack other presumptive evidence of measles immunity,"" meaning laboratory evidence of immunity or documentation of immunization (6).
 
 
 
 Conversely, the recommendation for administering a second MMR dose in childhood was adopted in 1989, and those born after that time do not require an additional vaccine dose. There are no criteria, even during an outbreak, for administering a third dose of MMR.
 
 
 
 What about all other adults? In the absence of a measles epidemic, the CDC does not recommend revaccinating adults born between 1957 and 1989. One dose of MMR vaccine is considered adequate for most adults, and after vaccination ""there is no recommendation for a catch-up program among adults for a second dose of MMR"" (6). Also, providers do not generally require screening patients for evidence of immunity.
 
 
 
 However, during measles epidemics (or presumably if measles returns widely across the USA), the CDC notes that ""health departments may provide additional recommendations to protect their communities, including a second dose"" for adults. Along those lines, the Texas DSHS recently recommended for adults living in the 10 affected counties that those born after 1957 (and received one MMR vaccine from that time) receive a second dose (4). If measles returns widely across the USA, this could become a new standard recommendation. The rationale: Although a single dose of MMR vaccine is still considered to give lifelong protection against measles, its effectiveness (93%) is less than 2 doses (97%). In addition, a small percentage of adults who were children during a period from 1963 to 1967 may have received an inactivated measles vaccine that has since been withdrawn -- those individuals should receive 2 MMR doses spaced 28 days apart (6).
 
 
 
 Because the MMR vaccine contains live virus strains, it is contraindicated for pregnant women or those with severe immunodeficiency. However, the MMR vaccine can be given to HIV-infected children and adults who do not have evidence of severe immunosuppression, which the CDC defines on the basis of CD4 counts and percentages (6). The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy has also issued guidelines for MMR immunizations after immunosuppressive therapies for cancer and hematopoietic cell transplantations (7).
 
 
 
 Regarding international travel, currently no country requires documentation of measles vaccination or immune status for entry. However, given the increase of measles both in the USA and abroad, the CDC recommends that children receive 2 MMR vaccine doses, or that infants aged 6 through 11 months receive their first dose of MMR vaccine, followed by 2 additional doses according to the routine schedule (6). Adults should also receive 2 doses of MMR or measles-containing vaccine unless they have presumptive evidence of immunity.
 
 
 
 Given the increase in antivaccine sentiments in Texas and the Great Plains, and increasingly across the United States (8), we may need to prepare for the possibility that our nation's measles elimination status could be lost. The current situation in West Texas and adjoining states could soon be replicated elsewhere.

 Measles in Peru -- Child returns infected from the USA, and epidemiological cordon is activated
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 A new case of measles in a child has raised alarms in the country's health system. The Ministry of Health (Minsa) confirmed that an 11-year-old boy, who had recently traveled to the USA -- a country facing active outbreaks of the disease in several cities -- tested positive for measles. Because this was an imported case, authorities issued an epidemiological alert to all health centers in the country due to the risk of reintroduction of the virus into the country.
 
 
 
 According to the Ministry of Health (MINSA), the diagnosis was made after a relative of the child was confirmed to have measles in the USA. The child is receiving medical care, and an epidemiological cordon has been activated to monitor all contacts. While no new suspected cases have been detected so far, the Ministry has strengthened surveillance in hospitals, health centers, and private clinics as a preventive measure.
 
 
 
 The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) warns that measles is easily transmitted through the air, through droplets expelled by an infected person when coughing or sneezing. As part of the immediate response, everyone close to an infected child is being vaccinated, and immunization campaigns have been intensified in various regions. The public is reminded that the measles vaccine is free and available at all public health centers.
 
 
 
 In addition to strengthening epidemiological surveillance, the Ministry of Health (MINSA) has mobilized its network of public and private health centers to respond to any potential outbreak. At the same time, information campaigns are being launched for parents to emphasize the importance of completing their children's vaccination schedules.
 
 
 
 PAHO has reiterated that measles eradication will only be possible if vaccination coverage is maintained at or above 95%, with the administration of 2 doses. It also recommends strengthening health surveillance systems to promptly detect any suspected cases, especially those with a history of travel abroad. If new infections are confirmed, PAHO emphasizes the need to act quickly through targeted vaccination campaigns and actively searching for potentially infected individuals to prevent further spread of the virus.
 
 
 
 In an interview with El Comercio, Dr. C√©sar Munayco, director general of the National Center for Epidemiology, Prevention, and Disease Control of the Ministry of Health (Minsa), explained that the affected child is 11 years old and that, during a trip to Nebraska, United States, he had contact with a cousin. Upon returning to Peru, he was informed that this relative had been diagnosed with measles.
 
 
 
 ""The United States is experiencing a serious epidemic, as are Mexico, Canada, and several European countries, which increases the risk of imported cases. The minor has already been discharged, and we are currently coordinating with different centers to monitor possible cases that may come from abroad,"" he noted.
 
 
 
 Regarding the epidemiological cordon, the specialist indicated that it is a strategy to prevent the spread of new cases. ""Once a case is identified, rigorous monitoring is carried out. So far, no other associated cases have been found. Basically, an area of up to five 5 blocks around the patient's home is blocked off, and people in the surrounding area are checked for symptoms. Although no additional cases have yet been identified, monitoring will continue for several days,"" he added.
 
 
 
 Dr. Munayco emphasized that the most important preventive measure is vaccination, especially for children traveling abroad. ""Anyone who develops a fever followed by a rash should immediately go to the nearest health center for evaluation. Unfortunately, in recent years, vaccination schedule adherence has been affected because some families are reluctant to get vaccinated. It is essential to adhere to the free schedule to protect lives,"" he emphasized.
 
 
 
 For her part, Dr. Virginia Garaycochea Cannon, vice dean of the Peruvian Medical Association and a pediatrician, noted that symptoms that should be addressed include nasal congestion, red eyes, sore throat, persistent dry cough, and high fever.
 
 
 
 ""Later, a rash appears on different parts of the body. Epidemiological fencing is essential; it involves identifying the source of infection, isolating it, and determining who has been in contact with the patient. These contacts are vaccinated or kept under strict surveillance. It is meticulous work, very similar to that of health intelligence,"" she explained.
 
 
 
 Dr. Garaycochea recommended that anyone with compatible symptoms immediately isolate themselves and seek medical attention without exposing others along the way. ""If the doctor detects a high level of suspicion, they may ask the patient to open their mouth to identify the so-called 'Koplik spot,' a characteristic sign of measles, and thus activate the isolation protocol,"" she commented.
 
 
 
 Regarding the impact of the anti-vaccine movement, the specialist recalled that it originated in a fraudulent study linking vaccines to autism, a connection that was denied and discredited by the scientific community. ""Measles is not a mild disease. It can be very serious and has no specific treatment. That's why it's crucial for the population to understand that the best way to protect themselves is to complete their vaccination schedule,"" she concluded.

 2 new measles cases confirmed in Cass County; 1 hospitalized
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Two new measles cases were confirmed in Cass County on Sunday [11 May 2025], bringing North Dakota's total cases to 11 since 2 May 2025, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services. The department reported both people were unvaccinated and 1 was hospitalized as a result of the disease. Both people are believed to have contracted measles from international travel.
 
 
 
 Two Essentia Health clinics in the Fargo area were exposed to the disease and public health officials said unvaccinated individuals present at those facilities should quarantine themselves for 21 days to monitor for symptoms. The 2 clinics exposed were:
 
 
 
 - Essentia Health - The Lights West Fargo Clinic from 2:30 to 6 p.m., 7 May 2025. The entrance to the clinic is shared with Bar Down Sports Bar and Restaurant.
 
 - Essentia Health Walk-in Care Clinic from 5:30 to 8 p.m., 9 May 2025.
 
 
 
 Last week, public health officials reported 3 schools in Williston were exposed to measles that resulted in about 150 unvaccinated students isolating at home to monitor for symptoms. Nine measles cases have been confirmed in Williams County since 2 May 2025.
 
 
 
 The health department recommends children between 12-15 months old should receive their 1st dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and a 2nd dose between 4-6 years of age. 
 
 
 
 ""People who are vaccinated and exposed to measles are not likely to develop the disease,"" said Molly Howell, immunization director for HHS. ""MMR vaccination is critical to preventing the spread of measles in the community. Anyone who is eligible and has not yet been vaccinated is encouraged to contact a trusted health care provider about MMR vaccination.""
 
 
 
 Howell said the MMR vaccine is 93% effective after one dose and 97% effective after a 2nd dose. Adults born before 1957 are generally presumed immune due to natural exposure, the department said.
 
 
 
 Immunization records for North Dakota residents can be reviewed through the HHS website or by contacting a health care provider.

 [A case or so of recognized measles in travelers does not, however, necessarily set off an autochthonous outbreak. With measles, having a well-immunized population will prevent this, along with rapid recognition of the index case for isolation and contact identification purposes. It is the same with gastrointestinal diseases such as cholera, but instead of immunization, the population is protected by an adequate sewage system. Public health has protected us in many ways. The 1st 2025 case in North Dakota's Williams County was acquired from a traveler. Hopefully, that it not an omen for Cass County. - Mod.LL]

 Cuyahoga County reports 1st confirmed measles case in 2025
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 
 Cuyahoga County has confirmed its 1st case of measles in 2025, in an unvaccinated child. The child was previously treated at the Cleveland Clinic's Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights, and sent home to isolate until it ran its course, according to a Thursday [8 May 2025] news release from the Cuyahoga County Board of Health.
 
 
 
 County health officials are now warning people who were in the hospital's atrium lobby between 3:50 p.m. and 6:15 p.m. on Friday, 2 May 2025, that they may have been exposed. Hospital workers are now working with county health officials to notify people who are known to have been exposed.
 
 
 
 The child visited the hospital for lab work on Friday, 2 May 2025, according to the release. The child returned on Sunday, 4 May 2025, for emergency treatment, when medical officials suspected the child may have measles. The illness was first reported on Sunday, 4 May 2025, then confirmed to the Cuyahoga County Board of Health on Tuesday, 6 May 2025, according to the release.
 
 
 
 Anyone who was in the Hillcrest Hospital atrium lobby during that time who does not have evidence of immunity to measles is urged to quarantine at home, staying away from work, school or public places for at least 21 days.
 
 
 
 In Northeast Ohio, Ashtabula, Holmes and Knox counties have reported confirmed measles cases this year [2025]. Ohio reported 90 cases of measles in 2022, including 85 cases related to an outbreak in Central Ohio, according to the release. There was 1 case in 2023 and 7 in 2024.

 KDHE reports positive measles case in Reno County
 
 -------------------------------------------------
 
 Health officials have confirmed a positive case of measles found in a person living in Reno County. According to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE), the case is not associated with any of the USA measles outbreaks and does not represent community transmission in Reno County. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines an outbreak of measles as 3 or more related cases.
 
 
 
 KDHE is notifying individuals who were exposed to the person that tested positive while they were infectious. Health officials are also warning the public of potential exposure to measles to limit the spread. KDHE says the risk of exposure to measles in Hutchinson is only limited to the Hutchinson Public Library on Saturday, 3 May 2025 from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. The measles virus can stay in the air and on surfaces for up to 2 hours. Because the measles virus is highly contagious, anyone who visited the Hutchinson Public Library at the date and times listed above may have been exposed to measles.

 Mid-South steel factory site of potential measles exposure, health department says
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 A confirmed measles exposure at Big River Steel is sparking public health concerns across Mississippi County. The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) is urging anyone who may have been at the plant during a specific exposure window to monitor for symptoms and check their vaccination records. As of 7 May 2025, the ADH has confirmed 6 measles cases statewide in 2025.
 
 
 
 The latest potential exposure was identified at Big River Steel, a major manufacturing facility in Osceola that employs hundreds of workers across the region. A steelworker at the facility told FOX13 he was surprised to hear the virus had returned. ""But I feel that is crazy that, uh, something that has come back around that was kind of a scary thing,"" Smith said.
 
 
 
 The ADH has not specified the exact dates or times of the exposure at Big River Steel, but officials are encouraging anyone who works at or recently visited the facility to stay vigilant for symptoms. Residents in the community are also expressing concern. ""That's crazy. I mean, is it children or adults?"" asked a local resident. ""People should be aware of it. They should alert others to what's going on so they can choose whether or not to get vaccinated.""
 
 
 
 At this time, the ADH confirms there is no ongoing risk at Big River Steel but is continuing to monitor the situation. Officials are emphasizing that the MMR vaccine remains the most effective way to prevent infection and curb the spread.

 Israel: 5 children hospitalized in ICU with measles
 
 ----------------------------------------
 
 The Israeli Health Ministry announced on Thursday [15 May 2025] that 5 unvaccinated children have been in intensive care after contracting measles, as part of a growing global resurgence of the disease. Three of the children remain in critical care units, according to the statement. In response, Israeli health authorities have launched an emergency vaccination campaign targeting both children and adults in areas with low immunization rates.
 
 
 
 A total of 48 measles cases have been reported in Israel during the current outbreak, according to the ministry. More than 75% of those infected were not fully vaccinated. Of the 48 patients, 40 are minors -- none of whom received the full 2-dose vaccine.
 
 
 
 In 2018, an unvaccinated 18-month-old child in Jerusalem died of measles, marking Israel's first fatality from the disease in 15 years. The following year, a 43-year-old Israeli flight attendant, who had received only one dose of the vaccine, died after contracting the virus during a flight.

Louisiana set for record high whooping cough cases, state health officials say
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pertussis (whooping cough) cases in Louisiana are rapidly climbing and in 2025 the state is on track to set a record high in cases for the 1st time in over a decade. The Office of Public Health has identified 6 more whooping cough cases in Louisiana, bringing the total cases in 2025 to 170.

""This is a concerning number of cases, especially because the whooping cough is an incredibly is incredibly dangerous disease for infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated,"" Dr. Bruce Greenstein, Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health. ""Our little ones are vulnerable, and they rely on the rest of us, parents, caregivers, grandparents, older siblings, neighbors, and others, to help protect them.""

Louisiana is on track to set a record high in 2025, exceeding the previous record of 214 cases reported in 2013. The substantial increase in pertussis in Louisiana has caused a corresponding rise in hospitalizations and deaths, with 2 small children dying in 2025. LDH reminds residents that this disease is highly contagious, and you can protect yourself and your family by taking extra precautions.

 Nearly 20 new measles cases confirmed in Kansas amid outbreak; no new cases in Missouri
 
 -----------------------------------------------
 
 A measles outbreak continues to plague Kansans, with more than a dozen new cases across the state. As of Wed 14 May 2025, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) is reporting 56 confirmed cases of measles across the state; 54 cases are associated with an ongoing outbreak in southwest Kansas.
 
 
 
 As of 23 Apr 2025, there were 37 cases in the state. Three weeks later, there are nearly 20 new cases of measles in Kansas.
 
 
 
 Most cases continue to present among unvaccinated children,"" the KDHE said on its website. ""Due to the highly contagious nature of measles, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area in Kansas and in surrounding counties, especially among those that are unvaccinated. As summer travel season begins, we will likely see additional imported cases among Kansans traveling within the USA and internationally.""
 
 
 
 Measles cases have been confirmed in 10 Kansas counties: Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray, Haskell, Kiowa, Morton, Reno, Sedgwick, and Stevens.
 
 
 
 Gray County has 21 measles cases -- the highest number of cases in the state. Haskell and Stevens counties are next in line, with 8 and 7 cases, respectively.

 The State Department of Health and Human Services has confirmed one more case of measles in North Dakota. According to the department's measles dashboard, the 12th case of measles in the state was confirmed in Williams County. This brings the total outbreak to 10 cases in Williams County and 2 in Cass County.
 
 
 
 The measles dashboard shows the age range of those who have come down with the disease. The dashboard says 3 males and 9 females have tested positive. Of the cases, 4 are children under age 10 and 5 are between the ages of 10 and 19. Another 2 cases are individuals in their 30s, and one is in their 40s. There has been one hospitalization related to measles infection. All cases have been confirmed in unvaccinated individuals.

 OSDH reports 17 cases of measles in Oklahoma this year
 
 --------------------------------------------------
 
 Measles in Oklahoma has increased to almost 20 cases since the outbreak began in West Texas in January [2025]. As of 13 May [2025], there have been 17 measles cases in Oklahoma, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. Fourteen cases are confirmed, while only 3 cases are probable.
 
 
 
 Of the 17 cases, 15 have been reported in unvaccinated individuals. It is currently unknown if one of the other individuals has a measles vaccine. This is because the individual does not have any documented doses of the measles vaccine more than 14 days before exposure, as it takes 14 days after vaccination to develop immunity and be considered vaccinated, according to OSDH.
 
 
 
 Cases have been detected in individuals 57 years old down to at least one baby who was not yet one year old, OSDH reports. There have been no documented deaths or hospitalizations in Oklahoma for measles. While it is unknown to the public which counties have residents with measles, the OSDH does provide a map of counties with increased exposure chances.

 The Waco-McLennan County Public Health District on 14 May [2025] confirmed a case of measles in McLennan County. The single case involves an unvaccinated minor, the health district said. Health officials are actively investigating and preventing further spread of the disease. It has not been determined where the minor contracted measles, according to health officials. However, there are no reported local public exposures in relation to this case as of now.
 
 
 
 The patient was tested at a Central Texas medical facility, and infection control protocols were used.
 
 
 
 ""Measles is more than just a rash -- it's a serious disease that can lead to severe complications,"" said Stephanie Alvey, interim director of the Waco-McLennan County Public Health District. ""Vaccination is our strongest tool to prevent outbreaks and protect our communities.""

 <https://publichealthinsider.com/2025/05/13/potential-exposure-to-measles-from-traveler-at-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-and-nearby-hotel-2-2/>
 
 
 
 
 
 Public Health - Seattle & King County was notified of a confirmed measles case in a Canadian resident. The person spent time in King and Snohomish counties between 30 Apr and 3 May 2025 while infectious. The individual's vaccine status is unknown.‚ÄØ
 
 
 
 In addition to traveling through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, the person visited multiple public locations in Renton, Bellevue, Seattle, Everett, and Woodinville while contagious with measles, but before being diagnosed with measles. If you are not immune to measles, or don't know your vaccination status, please see the list below for locations of potential exposure.
 
 
 
 This case is not connected to any previous local measles cases. Public Health - Seattle & King County has responded to 2 other measles cases this year [2025] among people who traveled through King County but are not Washington state residents. There have been 5 cases of measles in Washington state residents this year [2025].
 
 
 
 ""Globally and in the USA, we are experiencing a significant measles resurgence. With over 1000 cases reported so far this year nationally, 2025 is on track to have the highest number of measles cases in the US since the early 1990s,"" said Meagan Kay, medical epidemiologist for Public Health - Seattle & King County. ""It's an important time to check your vaccination status and get vaccinated if you aren't protected.""
 
 
 
 Fortunately, the measles vaccine is very effective. Two doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine provides about 97% protection against getting infected by measles, and that protection lasts a lifetime.
 
 
 
 Spread of measles can occur before people know they have the disease, before any rash appears.
 
 
 
 The infected person was at the following public locations before being diagnosed with measles. These times include the estimated period when the individual was at the location and 2 hours after. Measles virus can remain in the air for up to 2 hours after someone infectious with measles leaves the area. Anyone who was at the following locations during the times listed could have been exposed to measles:

 A fast-spreading measles outbreak is sweeping across Somaliland, with more than 220 confirmed cases prompting urgent calls for vaccination and heightened public health surveillance.
 
 
 
 The Ministry of Health Development said Thursday [15 May 2025] that 227 cases have been recorded across 6 regions, with the majority in Hargeisa and Berbera. Health authorities have raised concerns over the virus's rapid transmission, especially among children, many of whom are now being treated in hospitals.
 
 
 
 ""This is a nationwide outbreak, and measles is a serious illness,"" said Dr. Ahmed Mahmoud Jama, director general of the ministry. ""It primarily affects children, but the consequences go far beyond the individual. The disease threatens to disrupt our healthcare system and economy.""
 
 
 
 According to health officials, 30 suspected cases were tested before the outbreak was declared -- 26 were confirmed positive. Hospitals in Hargeisa are managing a surge in cases, with some patients in critical condition, though no fatalities have been officially confirmed.
 
 The regional case breakdown is as follows:
 
 
 
 - Hargeisa: 160
 
 - Berbera: 27
 
 - Burao: 14
 
 - Sheikh: 5
 
 - Aynaba: 4
 
 - Smaller clusters: Baligubadle, Erigavo, Gabiley
 
 
 
 Measles is a viral illness spread through coughing, sneezing, and close contact. Symptoms include high fever, persistent cough, runny nose, and red rashes that appear on the skin. The disease is preventable through vaccination, but inconsistent coverage and limited access to health services have left many children in the region vulnerable.
 
 
 
 The outbreak adds to a growing list of health challenges in the region. In recent years, dengue fever -- a mosquito-borne illness not previously common in Somaliland -- has also emerged, leading to several deaths and straining already fragile health infrastructure.
 
 
 
 Health authorities urge parents to seek medical care at the 1st sign of symptoms and to ensure their children receive routine immunizations. Emergency vaccination campaigns are being planned to contain the spread.
 
 
 
 With measles now confirmed in all 6 regions, officials warn that the outbreak could worsen without swift intervention and support from local and international health partners.
 
 
 
 The outbreak comes as the region continues to battle multiple infectious disease threats. On World Polio Day last October [2024], the Federal Ministry of Health in Mogadishu, backed by WHO and UNICEF, urged intensified vaccination campaigns to fight what remains the world's longest-running outbreak of variant poliovirus type 2. Health Minister Dr. Ali Haji Adam warned that unless immunization efforts were expanded, diseases like measles, cholera, and polio could overwhelm Somalia's already stretched health infrastructure, especially in drought-affected or flooded regions where vaccine access is limited.

Poland has recorded a record increase in whooping cough cases. The number of cases in 2024 was more than 30 thousand, which is 35 times more than in the previous year [2023]. Such figures are cited by Polish media, citing data from the National Institute of Public Health. 

Experts warn that the problem could worsen. In the first 2 months of 2025 alone, 5000 new cases have already been recorded. There are at least 2 reasons that may contribute to the increase in the incidence of pertussis.

The first is the low level of pertussis vaccinations among adults, despite the fact that immunity expires every 8-10 years. In Poland, vaccination of children is mandatory, and there is little awareness of the need for regular vaccination for adults. This affects the decrease in the general immunity of the population, which is of concern, especially in the context of pathogen mutation.

Migration has become an additional risk factor for the development of whooping cough. Other factors also contributed to the increase in the incidence of pertussis.

 Hepatitis A outbreak in Kyiv: more than 30 children are ill, the source of infection has not yet been established
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 In the capital's Vidradny microdistrict, an outbreak of viral hepatitis A has been recorded -- 65 people have fallen ill, including 31 children. Due to the incident, all schoolchildren in the district have been transferred to distance learning. The cause of the outbreak is still being investigated. This was announced during a briefing by Natalia Gunchenko, Deputy Director General of the Kyiv City Center for Disease Control and Prevention, reports UNN.
 
 
 
 According to the specialist, there is no specific treatment for this disease. The only thing for prevention is a vaccine against viral hepatitis A. It is not included in the calendar of mandatory vaccinations. It is included in the recommended vaccinations. The population can buy the vaccine at their own expense and vaccinate both adults and children. As of 10 May 2025, 330 people have been vaccinated at their own expense. Most of them are children, fewer adults said the medic.
 
 
 
 Gunchenko noted that viral hepatitis affects all age groups of the population, but most often children and young people under the age of 35 are at risk. Older people are more likely to have already ""had"" the disease and, accordingly, have immunity to it. The investigation into the sources of the outbreak in the capital is still ongoing.
 
 
 
 Given that the disease has a fairly long incubation period (almost up to 50 days), experts have to conduct a retrospective study of the outbreak: take water samples from reservoirs, drinking fountains and centralized water supply. In addition, many people, especially children and adolescents, are being tested for the disease.
 
 
 
 Earlier, UNN wrote that 34 cases of hepatitis A were recorded in Kyiv, 20 of which were in children. The causes of the outbreak are being investigated, experts are conducting epidemiological investigation and taking anti-epidemic measures.

 Measles Case Confirmed in Williamsburg
 
 --------------------------------------
 
 A confirmed case of measles has been reported in the Williamsburg neighborhood, raising serious concern among local health professionals about the potential for a broader outbreak, particularly within the frum community. Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can lead to severe health complications, especially in young children. With dense populations and close-knit social networks, the risk of rapid spread in the community is significantly higher.
 
 
 
 ""Nobody wants their child to get measles,"" warned local Crown Heights physician Dr. Eli Rosen of the Crown Heights ODA, in a message to patients. Dr. Rosen stressed that if your child is unvaccinated or missing a booster, to schedule an appointment to get vaccinated.
 
 
 
 The Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is proven to be both safe and effective. Two doses -- typically administered at ages 1 and 4 -- offer up to 97% protection against the disease.
 
 
 
 This development comes as health officials continue to emphasize the importance of proactive prevention measures to avoid a repeat of past outbreaks.

Ontario reports 182 new measles cases, surpassing 1600 since outbreak began
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials say measles has infected 182 more people in Ontario over the last week, bringing the province's case count to 622 since an outbreak began in October [2024]. Public Health Ontario's measles report says there have been 119 hospitalizations, including 9 intensive care cases. Of those hospitalized, 95 percent were unvaccinated, including 89 children.

This is the third consecutive week Ontario is reporting that new cases are in the 200-range, which is on the higher end since experts started keeping track of weekly spread.

Southwestern Public Health Unit's Dr. Ninh Tran called the province's case count over the last few weeks ""significant."" His public health unit is still where most of the new cases are concentrated. However, he says most cases are no longer infectious.

""This week has been the highest week, and it is being driven by really good detection and significant transmissions in households,"" Tran says.

Southwestern [Ontario] has had 104 new cases reported locally over the past week, he says, which is higher than the province's data because of differences in reporting periods.

Measles cases in Alberta have reached nearly 400 since mid-March [2025], infecting just over 120 kids under age 5. The highly contagious disease continues to primarily infect unvaccinated children, infants, and teenagers, both in Ontario and Alberta.

Southern Alberta sees spike in measles cases
----------------------------------
The number of patients suffering from measles grew by 29 cases in southern Alberta Friday [16 May 2025], a daily increase greater than what the entire USA recorded in a week. The rise brings the total number of reported cases in Alberta to 438, most of which are concentrated in southern Alberta, where almost 300 people have come down with the disease. The region is followed by the Central Zone with 91 confirmed cases. Edmonton and Calgary have reported 6 and 11 cases, respectively.

The figure has made Alberta the province with the second-highest number of cases in the country, behind Ontario, where the number of people with the disease exceeded 1600 as of Friday [16 May 2025].

The CDC reported 20 new cases in the US between 4 and 11 May, and another 2 cases between 11 and 15 May [2025].

The rate of measles in Alberta is highest among children aged under 5 to 17. More than 350 people suffering from the disease belong to the cohort. Children under 5 are most at risk of serious complications, particularly babies who are aged 6 to 12 months, said Dr. James Talbot, public health physician and the province's former chief medical officer of health, in an interview last week.

During a panel hosted by the Alberta Medical Association on 8 May [2025], he urged Albertan families to move quickly on getting themselves and their children vaccinated, citing 3 reasons. The first, he said, is that measles is widely known to be a highly contagious virus that spreads quickly. Secondly, he explained that because it often takes time for measles symptoms to show up, there are probably more cases of the infection in Alberta than those reported.

""And thirdly, the percentage of kids unimmunized or partially immunized is very high in Alberta,"" he said.

The panel followed days after a provincial update on 5 May [2025], wherein Adriana LaGrange, the province's health minister, and Dr. Sunil Sookram, Alberta's interim chairperson confirmed that actions are being taken to expand the provincial response to the outbreak.

The most recent update arrives as measles makes a comeback in Canada, especially in Alberta, where immunization rates are among the lowest in the country. Provincial data shows that only 71.6 percent of 7-year-olds were fully vaccinated against measles in 2024.

In the south zone, where the majority of the cases are concentrated, multiple communities show vaccination rates well below 50 percent in 2024, including the County of Forty Mile (30.2 percent), Lethbridge (46.7 percent), and the Municipality of Taber (39.1 percent).

In the central zone, Two Hills Country reports a paltry vaccination rate of 24 percent. Out of 350 confirmed cases on 10 May [2025], 318 weren't vaccinated.

The low vaccination rates have been ascribed to vaccine hesitancy, anti-vaxxer sentiment, and a false sense of security from past infrequent exposure to the virus.

Montreal Public Health reports a case of measles
-------------------------------------------
A person in the midst of a contagious measles outbreak reportedly stayed in Montreal from 4 to 7 May [2025] and visited several places in the city, according to the Montreal Regional Public Health Department (DRSP). According to the notice issued Friday [16 May 2025] by the DRSP, the person visited 4 businesses, a hotel, and a private residence for seniors (RPA) during their stay in Montreal.

They reportedly stayed at the Quality Inn Dorval and visited the Ch√¢teau Pierrefonds residential care home. The list of places frequented by the person infected with measles also includes Boulangerie Non Solo Pane, Tacos Frida, Bar Messorem, and the Subway restaurant on Saint-Charles Boulevard in Kirkland.

The DRSP therefore urges anyone who has been exposed to measles to check whether they are adequately protected against measles. It reiterates that vaccination remains the best way to protect against this virus. Public Health also emphasizes that measles is an extremely contagious disease and that the risk of catching measles is 9 out of 10 if an unprotected person comes into contact with a sick person.

Quebec has faced 2 measles outbreaks, the last of which ended in April 2025. A senior medical advisor with the Public Health Agency of Canada says the country could lose its measles-eradication status if the highly contagious disease continues to spread in the fall.

Dr. Marina Salvadori warned of this possibility 2 weeks ago, as Ontario's case count rose by nearly 200 infections, adding that it would only happen if the prolonged spread continued beyond mid-October 2025. Even if the eradication status ends, she believes measles can be eliminated again in the country.

Measles eradication is the absence of continuous transmission of the disease for 12 months or more in a given geographic area. Canada achieved this status in 1998.

Rising measles cases in children worries Faryab officials
----------------------------------------------
Health officials in northern Faryab province have expressed concern over an increasing number of measles cases in children and are urging families not to neglect vaccinating their children against the disease. Dr. Arash Agha, head of the pediatric department at the 100-bed hospital in Maimana, told Pajhwok Afghan News that measles remained common in Faryab not only this year but also last year [2024].

More than 40 children with measles are admitted to the pediatric ward daily, which is above the capacity of the ward, and most patients may be referred to other health centers, private hospitals, and neighboring provinces, he added. He attributed the reason behind the increasing measles cases to poor coverage of routine vaccination, lack of awareness and people's lack of referral to health centers, irresponsibility of vaccinators who do not cover their respective areas, and delays in implementing the nationwide campaign.

Measles is a type of respiratory infection and its symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, and skin problems in various parts of the body. Despite the availability of a vaccine, it is still one of the causes of death worldwide. Dr. Agha urged families to pay serious attention to administering measles vaccine to their children.

Dr. Mohammad Ibrahim Karimi, chief physician at the provincial hospital, explained the hospital had a capacity of 100 beds and more than 140 children were admitted to the pediatric ward daily, most of them measles patients. Most of the severe measles patients are from remote districts and Ghormach district of western Badghis province, where there are no health facilities, he added.

Maulvi Khan Agha Asad, acting director of Public Health Department, confirms that the number of measles cases and deaths in the province have increased compared to previous years. In the past, a general campaign was launched every 5 years, but since 2022, no general campaign has been carried out, and most children born between 2022 and 2025 have not been vaccinated. The lack of awareness among people about the importance of vaccination, the distance of health centers from villages, the lack of transportation, and the aversion of some families towards vaccination are factors contributing to the increase in measles cases. The acting director asked families to vaccinate their children against this dangerous disease.

[H], a resident of Khwaja Sabzposh district, explained her grandson contracted measles almost 3 weeks ago. He is in critical condition and hospitalized in Maimana Hospital, but doctors have recommended he should be transferred to better-equipped hospitals outside the province for treatment.

Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.

The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.

Reports
The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting an outbreak of measles originating in Lea County, near Gaines County, Texas. The table below provides the latest case numbers. Because measles is highly contagious, additional cases are likely to occur.

We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays by noon Mountain Standard Time if there are new cases to report.

Measles Outbreak - 20 May 2025
------------------------------
The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is reporting an outbreak of measles primarily in West Texas.

- At this time, 722 cases have been confirmed since late January [2025]. This is an increase of 4 since the May 16 update.
- Less than 1%, or fewer than 10 of the confirmed cases, are estimated to be actively infectious since their rash onset date was less than a week ago.
- Individuals are infectious 4 days prior to and 4 days after rash onset.

Ninety-two of the patients have been hospitalized. This number is the total number of people hospitalized over the course of the outbreak. It is not the current number of people in the hospital.

There have been 2 fatalities in school-aged children who lived in the outbreak area. The children were not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.

Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities.

Based on the most recent data, DSHS has identified designated outbreak counties with ongoing measles transmission: Cochran, Dawson, Gaines, Lamar, Lubbock, Terry and Yoakum. Dallam County has been removed from the list of designated outbreak counties because it has been 42 days, or 2 incubation periods, since the last case was infectious.

DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak.

We will post updates on Tuesdays and Fridays.

Diphtheria situational report (week 19 of 2025)
-------------------------------------------
Between 1 Jan 2024 and 11 May 2025, 50 confirmed cases of respiratory diphtheria, one probable respiratory diphtheria case, one case of cutaneous toxigenic diphtheria, and 44 asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_, detected during contact tracing, have been identified in South Africa. The majority of confirmed respiratory diphtheria cases (62%, 31/50) were from the Western Cape. The median age for cases of confirmed respiratory diphtheria was 26.5 years (range: 2-55 years), with 72% (36/50) being 18 years and older. The overall case-fatality ratio (CFR) among probable and confirmed respiratory diphtheria cases was 22% (11/51). Among children and adolescents under 18 years, the CFR was 21% (3/14), compared to 22% (8/37) among adults.

Highlights
--------
Since the last situational report (week 18), the following updates are included in this report:
- one new laboratory-confirmed case of toxigenic respiratory diphtheria from Limpopo
- no new asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_
- one new laboratory-confirmed toxigenic cutaneous diphtheria from Gauteng
Appropriate public health responses have been initiated for each case.

Information for clinicians
--------------
Clinical presentation of respiratory diphtheria:

Respiratory diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable illness caused by toxigenic _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ (and, more rarely, _C. ulcerans_ or _C. pseudotuberculosis_), and can occur in persons of all ages.

The clinical presentation includes the following signs and symptoms:
- sore throat
- low-grade fever
- AND an adherent membrane of the nose, pharynx, tonsils, or larynx -- the membrane is greyish-white and firmly adherent to the tissue
- AND/OR enlarged glands in the neck (bull neck)
- toxin-mediated systemic signs including myocarditis, polyneuropathy, and renal damage

Patient management
------------
Treatment includes antibiotics (azithromycin or penicillin) to clear the organism from the throat and prevent onward transmission, and diphtheria anti-toxin (DAT) to neutralize unbound toxin. The dosage of DAT is determined by the duration and severity of illness. Treatment, contact tracing, and chemoprophylaxis should be started prior to laboratory confirmation. Early administration of DAT may be lifesaving and should not be delayed in cases with a high index of suspicion. Supportive care is primarily aimed at airway management and includes providing oxygen, monitoring with electrocardiogram, and intubation or performance of a tracheostomy if necessary.

Tragedy in Sonora: girl dies of measles in Sonora; 21 confirmed cases
-----------------------------------------------------
A tragic case has shaken the southern region of Sonora: a baby from Chihuahua, just 12 months old, lost her life after contracting measles. The minor, the daughter of a family of agricultural workers temporarily established in the Marte R. Gómez police station, in Cajeme, did not have a complete vaccination schedule and was severely malnourished.

This unfortunate death adds to a public health red light experienced in the state, since there are currently 21 confirmed cases of measles in Sonora, of which 19 correspond to people from Chihuahua who were working in a local agricultural area. Faced with this scenario, the health authorities have implemented immediate measures to prevent further spread of the virus.

The place where the infected were housed was surrounded by a sanitary fence and focused vaccination operations were activated. These works are in charge of the Basic Territorial Squadrons, made up of nursing personnel, health promoters, and brigade members, whose objective is to contain the contagion within the affected area and protect nearby communities.

The remaining 2 reported cases are located in Nogales and Hermosillo. Both patients have a history of being out of state before contracting the disease.

Manitoba becomes ground zero in Canada's measles crisis
------------------------------------------------
A highly contagious and potentially deadly disease, thought to be nearly eliminated from Canada, has returned with alarming speed. Manitoba is under threat as it faces a surge in measles cases, marking the province's most substantial outbreak in decades. Health officials have confirmed 60 cases as of now, with 4 additional probable cases under investigation. The outbreak, which began with the first reported case in February [2025], has seen a rapid escalation, with 42 new cases identified in May 2025 alone.

Experts warn that the actual number of infections may be higher due to delays between infection and laboratory confirmation.

Epidemiologist Cynthia Carr emphasized the contagious nature of measles, stating, ""This virus is very good at spreading. As a reminder, it can stay in the air 2 hours after the person infected with measles has been in the room and left.""

Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatrician and molecular virology professor at Baylor College of Medicine, highlighted the importance of vaccination in curbing the outbreak.

""The only way to stop the flow is to bolster herd immunity and get 90-95 percent vaccination rates. The only way you're going to slow this down is by a catch-up measles vaccination campaign,"" he said.

4th measles case confirmed in Georgia
--------------------------------------
A fourth measles case has been confirmed in Georgia, the Georgia Department of Public Health announced on Monday afternoon [19 May 2025]. According to state health officials, an unvaccinated metro Atlanta resident caught it while traveling internationally. Officials are now trying to find all the people who may have had contact with that individual between 10 and 18 May [2025]. Health officials reported that there were 6 cases of measles in 2024.

Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus can linger in the air or on surfaces for up to 2 hours after the infected individual has left the area. Symptoms typically appear between 7 and 14 days after exposure and often begin with a high fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes. A rash of small, red spots usually follows, starting at the head and spreading across the body. Health experts emphasize that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine remains the most effective defense against infection. The CDC recommends children receive the first dose of the MMR vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age, followed by a second dose between 4 and 6 years old. A single dose of the vaccine provides immunity to over 95% of recipients, while the second dose increases protection to about 98%.

Anyone experiencing symptoms consistent with measles should contact their healthcare provider immediately. However, officials strongly advise calling ahead before visiting a doctor's office, hospital, or public health clinic to reduce the risk of exposing others. Healthcare providers who suspect a case of measles are urged to notify public health authorities right away.

[A case or so of recognized measles in travelers does not necessarily set off an autochthonous outbreak. With measles, having a well-immunized population will prevent this, along with rapid recognition of the index case for isolation and contact identification purposes. It is the same with gastrointestinal diseases such as cholera, but instead of immunization, the population is protected by an adequate sewage system. Public health has protected us in many ways. - Mod.LL]

First positive measles case confirmed in Hays County
---------------------------------------
The Hays County Health Department (HCHD) was notified that a Kyle resident tested positive for measles by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). The individual is considered unvaccinated because they were unable to provide documentation of receiving the measles vaccine. The individual was contagious beginning Thu 11 May 2025, until 19 May 2025. The individual has received care, and public health officials are working to identify and notify individuals who may have been exposed.

Individuals who were at the places at the times listed below may be at risk of developing measles due to exposure to this individual. While the individual was not considered infectious during visits to the listed locations before 11 May, these locations are being included out of an abundance of caution due to the small possibility of early transmission.

In collaboration with DSHS, individuals who may have been exposed will be notified by their respective local health authority. HCHD, DSHS and other local health agencies are working closely together to investigate the potential contacts.

""Our department has thoroughly prepared for the chance of a positive measles case within the county. We have learned from the many lessons identified from the measles exposure in February of this year,"" Gonzales said. ""We are working closely with the healthcare providers and businesses exposed to ensure the safety of their patients and customers. The health and safety of our residents is our priority. Our focus will be ensuring those who are exposed are notified and capable of taking the proper precautions for their health and to prevent the further exposure of other individuals.""

HCHD will contact people who are known to have been in contact with the person who later tested positive for measles to provide guidance and conduct case investigations.

Ninety percent of people who are not vaccinated or have not had a previous measles infection will become infected with the virus [if exposed]. If an individual has symptoms, they should contact their primary care provider, an urgent care, or an emergency room to set up an appointment, and quarantine for 4 days after the onset of a rash.

Measles case confirmed in Flathead County
----------------------------------------
Health officials reported Wednesday [21 May 2025] that a measles case has been confirmed in Flathead County. The Flathead City-County Health Department (FCCHD) reports the case is in a Flathead County resident who has reported recent travel outside Flathead County. There is no clear indication of the exact point of exposure, and the adult -- vaccination status isn't currently known -- is isolating at home, a news release states.

""Our staff swiftly conducted the investigation upon receiving notification from the state and were able to quickly identify close contacts to prevent further spread. Staff are diligently working with local healthcare providers to remain in communication. We appreciate their partnership,"" said Health Officer Jen Rankosky.

FCCHD is working with the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) as an investigation into the measles case continues. Local health department staff have determined the person wasn't in any public settings while infectious, which means there's no known community exposures related to the measles case.

Flathead City-County Health Department Community Health Manager Rose Hash said vaccination is the most effective way to protect yourself from measles.

""Measles vaccination with the MMR vaccine is 97% effective if you have both doses; it's a routine pediatric vaccine with the 2 doses,"" said Hash.

Person may have spread measles at Shakira concert in MetLife Stadium, health officials say
----------------------------
A person who attended a Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium on 15 May [2025] was infected with measles and may have spread the highly contagious virus at the event, health officials said Tuesday [20 May 2025]. Anyone who was at the stadium in East Rutherford from 7:30 p.m. through 1 a.m. may have been exposed to the virus, according to the state Department of Health.

Although viruses tend to spread more quickly indoors, measles can live in an airspace for up to 2 hours and is still highly transmissible, especially among the unvaccinated. No measles cases associated with the concert have been reported, but symptoms could develop as late as 6 Jun [2025], health officials said. Anyone who suspects they have measles should call their health-care provider ahead of time so doctors and nurses can set up a special treatment section to limit any potential spread, health officials said Tuesday [20 May 2025].

The state Department of Health released little information about the infected concert goer, including where they sat or what entrance and exit they used. The highly anticipated concert drew tens of thousands of fans to East Rutherford. It was the first of back-to-back Shakira concerts at the stadium.

PAHO notifies city of São Paulo about new case of measles
---------------------------------------------------------
The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) notified the Municipal Health Department of São Paulo about the confirmation of a case of measles. The case is considered to be imported. According to the ministry, the epidemiological investigation -- still in progress -- indicates that the probable place of infection was not the municipality of São Paulo.

The baby, 1 year and 2 months old, traveled with his parents to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, on 25 March [2025]. The signs and symptoms compatible with measles, with the onset of rash (red spots on the skin), were identified on 16 April. The child received care at a local health service, where he was diagnosed with the infection. The secretariat did not inform the baby's health status or the neighborhood of residence in the capital of São Paulo.

On 17 April 2025, the São Paulo State Health Department had confirmed the registration of the first case of measles in the state in 2025. The place of infection is unknown, according to the secretariat said this Thursday [15 May 2025] in a note. The patient -- a 31-year-old man who lives in the capital of São Paulo -- was vaccinated against the disease and did not need to be hospitalized.

In October 2024, the municipality of São Paulo recorded 2 imported cases of measles. They were the only ones of 2024. The patients -- a 35-year-old woman and a 37-year-old man, residents of Cidade Ademar, in the south of the capital of São Paulo -- had a recent history of travel to Europe. There was no need for hospitalization.

Last year [2024], Brazil was recertified by PAHO for the elimination of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome. Since 2022, the country has not recorded any cases of the diseases. This was the second time that Brazil received the certificate for measles eradication. The first was delivered in 2016, but lost in 2018 after factors such as migratory flow from neighboring countries, reintroduction of the virus in Brazil and new outbreaks of the disease -- in the period, 39 779 cases were registered.

Pregnant Ontarians are getting caught up in the measles outbreak. Doctors are racing to figure out how to care for them
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Michelle Barton worried when measles found a foothold in southwestern Ontario last fall [2024]. The infectious disease specialist knew childhood vaccination rates hadn't bounced back to pre-pandemic levels in Ontario, leaving some kids exposed to the virus. There were also communities with high numbers of unvaccinated people near her hospital in London that were especially vulnerable to the extremely infectious disease. Anyone who wasn't immune would likely get measles.

""It's like a forest fire,"" said Barton, division head of Paediatric Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre. ""It will continue to burn until all the trees are gone.""

At first, many of those sick enough to need hospital care were infants and young children. As the outbreak spread, cases swelling from dozens to hundreds to now more than 1600 provincewide, a new group of measles patients has emerged -- one that few doctors in Canada have treated before.

Pregnant people were getting sick with measles. And Barton, working at the outbreak's epicentre, raced to figure out how to care for them and their babies. ""Because we're now talking about not just one patient, but 2 or 3,"" she said. ""Measles is hitting the adult mother, and it's hitting her baby in her womb.""

Ontario's measles outbreak, the largest in Canada in almost 30 years, started last October 2024 and has since sickened hundreds of people, the majority unvaccinated infants, children and teens. As of 13 May 2025, the outbreak has led to at least 1622 cases, including 119 who have been hospitalized, according to Public Health Ontario. Of those hospitalized, 89 were unimmunized children. Though kids have borne the brunt, adults are also getting sick. At least 377 people 20 and older, about two-thirds of whom were not vaccinated, have now been infected with what is typically thought of as a childhood disease.

Before routine immunization programs slashed measles cases in Canada, few people would get to child-bearing age without natural immunity. Now, in the post-vaccine era, people who did not get vaccinated as children have grown up to become ""vulnerable hosts,"" said Barton. ""In a full-blown outbreak, with measles circulating in their community, (unvaccinated) pregnant women are at risk.""

Studies from other countries show unvaccinated pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized, develop pneumonia and die from measles than those who are not pregnant. Measles also threatens the fetus or unborn baby. An infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, premature birth and cause low birth weight. ""If there's one group of people you really need to avoid getting serious infections, it's pregnant women,"" said Dawn Bowdish, an immunologist and professor of medicine at McMaster University.

In mid-March [2025], Public Health Ontario started tracking the number of pregnant people infected with measles during the outbreak. Seven such cases at the time have grown to 34 in 2 months. In response to a request by the Star, the agency provided figures for the number of pregnant cases admitted to hospital between 18 October 2024 and 29 April 2025. During that period, the province recorded 25 pregnant measles cases. Among those, 6 were hospitalized, including one admitted to the ICU. Five of those cases were unimmunized, while one case had received 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine.

Some of the pregnant people infected with measles are likely part of specific populations that historically haven't been vaccinated, Bowdish said. Health officials have confirmed Mennonite, Amish and other communities with low immunization rates have the highest rates of disease in this outbreak.

Unvaccinated pregnant women may also be part of a cohort of young adults whose parents refused childhood immunizations following a now-invalidated study that falsely linked the mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism, Bowdish said. Research shows the study, published in 1998 and since retracted, was associated with a decline in uptake of the MMR vaccine.

""There's a worry that there are quite a few people (of child-bearing age) who weren't vaccinated or who don't know their vaccine status, because you can't remember what Mom and Dad did when you were a child,"" Bowdish said. She noted people who are thinking of starting a family don't typically check their MMR vaccination status. Up until this outbreak, there was a low risk of getting a measles infection in Ontario.

""My big concern is that we're in this terrible situation, where we know people aren't vaccinated, where we're seeing measles spread into more and more communities, leading to more and more opportunities for pregnant people to get infected,"" said Bowdish.

Vaccinated individuals with compromised immune systems are also at risk of infection during pregnancy, said Barton. ""The new group that we're seeing...is women who have now come to their adult years and were never vaccinated,"" she said. ""This is distinctly different from the pre-vaccine era where those women would have acquired natural immunity in childhood.""

Dr. Darine El-Chaar, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at The Ottawa Hospital, said changes in a person's immune system during pregnancy make them generally more susceptible to infections, which is why it is important to update vaccines before starting a family. Once pregnant, individuals aren't generally immunized against measles out of an abundance of caution because the shot, which is an attenuated (weakened) live virus vaccine, poses a theoretical risk to a fetus, El-Chaar said.

Unimmunized pregnant people who get exposed to measles are offered immunoglobulin (Ig), which consists of antibodies made from donated human blood and offers protection from infection, or reduces disease severity. Ig must be giving as early as possible after exposure and within a 6-day window.

El-Chaar, a subject-matter expert for the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, said keeping up strong herd immunity is critical. ""I wish people would understand that when we refuse vaccines when we can take them, we're making it worse for those who can't be vaccinated,"" she said.

At the start of the outbreak, Barton said she scoured the medical literature for clues on how measles would affect pregnant patients and their unborn babies. Though there are few recent reports, Barton said a US study from 1993 found that about 60% of unimmunized pregnant women with measles needed hospital care, with 27% getting sick with pneumonia.

Since measles increases the risk of pregnancy loss and premature birth, Barton said she looked for guidance on these complications, too. One 2014 study from Namibia showed that 30% of unvaccinated pregnant women exposed to the virus would go into labor within 7 days, and 50% would deliver within 3 weeks.

Barton, who confirmed London Health Sciences Centre was managing the bulk of complicated cases in the region, would not reveal how many pregnant measles patients and their babies the hospital has cared for during the outbreak due to patient privacy concerns. Instead, she stressed how hard she and her colleagues are working to care for these vulnerable patients. ""We're still at the height of things, but we're determined to find the answers.""

While there has been no community spread of measles, an increase in pertussis raises health concerns
-----------------------------------------------------
In addition to recent measles concerns, cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, have increased at a worrying rate in Hawaii. As of 15 May [2025], 108 cases have been reported, exceeding the 84 total cases for all of 2024.

Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease spread through the air via the coughs or sneezes of an infected person. Initially, the symptoms resemble a cold but can progress to intense coughing fits. In children, coughing fits can be followed by a deep breath that makes a ""whooping"" sound. Health complications can be serious and even life-threatening, especially for infants and young children who are not fully vaccinated. Complications include pneumonia, seizures, apnea (a pause in breathing), encephalopathy (a disease of the brain), and death.

The most effective way to prevent pertussis is through vaccination with either the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) or the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccines. Multiple doses are recommended for infants, children, and adults.

High vaccination rates protect individuals and communities and prevent cases from becoming outbreaks. However, vaccination rates for all routinely recommended vaccinations for school entry -- including those for measles, pertussis, polio, and varicella (chickenpox) -- have declined nationally and in Hawaii since 2019. Hawaii is now below national averages.

The Department of Health strongly recommends that children and adults stay up to date with recommended vaccinations to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases and encourages discussing vaccine-related questions or concerns with a trusted healthcare provider.

Situation at a glance
----------------
On 9 May 2025, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) for Papua New Guinea (PNG) notified WHO of the detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) from stool specimens of 2 healthy children from Morobe province, Papua New Guinea (PNG). The detection of wild poliovirus (WPV) or vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), including from samples taken from healthy children, is considered a serious public health event. Given the country's suboptimal routine immunization coverage, especially at the subnational level, the risk of potential spread locally is considered high. WHO advises all countries -- especially those with frequent travel and connections to polio-affected areas -- should strengthen acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and environmental surveillance while maintaining high level of immunization coverage to quickly detect and respond to virus importation and prevent further spread by closing immunity gaps.

Description of the situation

On 9 May 2025, the IHR NFP for Papua New Guinea (PNG) notified WHO of the detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) from stool specimens of 2 healthy children from Lae city, Morobe province, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Stool samples from 25 healthy children were collected on 10 Apr 2025 as part of an in-depth epidemiological investigation in the catchment area of the environmental surveillance (ES) site, which reported cVDPV2 on 4 Apr 2025. On 8 May [2025], the WHO Polio Regional Reference Laboratory in Australia, the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL), confirmed that 2 of these children tested positive for poliovirus type 2. The children who tested positive for the poliovirus are from 2 separate villages within the ES catchment area in Lae city and were asymptomatic at the time of sample collection.

All isolates were classified as cVDPV2 and were genetically linked to the environmental sample detected on 4 Apr 2025. Genetic sequencing revealed 18-19 nucleotide differences from the Sabin 2 vaccine strain. All isolates are closely related to each other and genetically linked to the INO-PAP-2 emergence that previously caused an outbreak in Indonesia.

The detection of circulating type 2 poliovirus is classified as a ""polio outbreak"" in accordance with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) Standard Operating Procedures for responding to a poliovirus event or outbreak.

In Papua New Guinea, vaccination coverage is low, which may facilitate the spread of cVDPV2. As of 2024, national vaccination coverage for the third dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV3) was 44%. In Morobe province, where the virus is currently detected, coverage with bivalent OPV (bOPV) remained below 40% over the past 5 years, ranging from 28-37%. Coverage for the first dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV1) has remained between 52-54%. However, Lae city has higher coverage, with 73% for bOPV and 90% for IPV1.

Epidemiology

Polio is a highly infectious disease that largely affects children under 5 years of age, causing permanent paralysis (approximately 1 in 200 infections) or death (2-10% of those paralyzed).

The virus is transmitted from person to person, mainly through the fecal-oral route or, less frequently, by contaminated water or food. The virus multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis. The incubation period is usually 7-10 days but can range from 4-35 days. Up to 90% of those infected are either asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms and the disease usually goes unrecognized.

Vaccine-derived poliovirus is a well-documented strain of poliovirus mutated from the strain originally contained in OPV. OPV contains a live, weakened form of poliovirus that replicates in the intestine for a limited period, thereby developing immunity by building up antibodies. On rare occasions, when replicating in the gastrointestinal tract, OPV strains can genetically change and may spread in communities that are not fully vaccinated against polio, especially in areas where there is poor hygiene, poor sanitation, or overcrowding. The lower the population's immunity, the longer vaccine-derived poliovirus survives, and the more genetic changes it undergoes.

In very rare instances, the vaccine-derived virus can genetically change into a form that can cause paralysis as does the wild poliovirus -- this is what is known as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV). The detection of VDPV in at least 2 different sources and at least 2 months apart, that are genetically linked, showing evidence of transmission in the community, is classified as ""circulating"" vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). Similar to wild poliovirus, cVDPVs can be of 3 types (1, 2, or 3); the current outbreak in Papua New Guinea is due to cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2).

Poliovirus is a pathogen targeted for global eradication, and Papua New Guinea was certified polio-free in 2000, along with the rest of the countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region, following the last reported case of wild poliovirus (WPV) in 1996.

However, in 2018, an outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) was declared in Lae City, in Morobe province, the same city now considered to be experiencing a new poliovirus outbreak. The current detection of cVDPV2 in an environmental sample and in healthy children in Lae city is both unusual and unexpected, as it is not related to the previous cVDPV1 polio outbreak in 2018.

Public health response

Following the laboratory result, the following actions have been taken:

- Continued activation of the national and provincial emergency operations centers.
- Enhanced acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and environmental surveillance to detect further transmission.
- Accelerated IPV catch-up activities nationwide to mitigate the risk of paralysis.
- Technical preparation underway for targeted immunization response using OPV2, in collaboration with GPEI partners.
- Cross-border coordination efforts to align with regional risk mitigation strategies.
- Provision of updates through the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism.

WHO risk assessment

The international spread of poliovirus was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the director-general of the WHO on 5 May 2014, and most recently, the PHEIC declaration was extended on 6 Nov 2024.

Following the global withdrawal of type 2 containing OPV from routine immunization programmes in April and May 2016, the risk of poliovirus transmission has increased due to declining mucosal immunity in children.

In Papua New Guinea, the recent detection of cVDPV2 in both healthy children and in the environment has led to a classification of a poliovirus outbreak. Given the country's suboptimal routine immunization coverage, especially at the subnational level, the risk of potential spread locally is considered high. While poliovirus has the potential to spread rapidly across large distances through human movement, the affected province does not share an international border. However, it is a major commercial hub and a designated seaport of entry, which increases the risk of virus importation and exportation and spread especially in the case of VDPVs and in communities with low or incomplete vaccination coverage.

It is important to note that the Western Pacific Region has been free of endemic poliomyelitis (polio) since 2000, and there are currently no other ongoing poliovirus outbreaks in the region. However, as long as any form of poliovirus continues to circulate anywhere in the world, there remains a risk of importation. Such importations can lead to new outbreaks if the virus is introduced into an area with low population immunity.

Globally from 1 Jan to 12 May 2025, a total of 49 cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) caused by cVDPV2 have been confirmed, including 21 from Ethiopia, 14 from Nigeria, 9 from Chad, and one case each reported from Angola, Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Niger, and Sudan. Environmental surveillance reported an additional 57 cVDPV2 isolates, mainly from Algeria, Chad, Djibouti, the occupied Palestinian territory including east Jerusalem, and Nigeria. In 2024, a total of 297 AFP cases were confirmed to be associated with cVDPV2, with majority of cases reported from 6 countries: Nigeria 98 cases (33%), Ethiopia 43 cases (14. 5%), Chad 39 cases (13.1%), Yemen 37 cases (12.5%), Niger 16 cases (5.4%), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo 15 cases (5.1%). The occurrence of cVDPV outbreaks, which emerge and circulate due to a lack of polio immunity in the population, shows the potential risk for further international spread. WHO will continue to closely monitor the global situation and stands ready to provide assistance as required.

WHO advice

It is important that all countries, particularly those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen AFP surveillance and initiate a planned expansion of environmental surveillance to rapidly detect new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction and to fill residual immunity gaps causing further spread.

Surveillance:
To limit the potential spread of poliovirus, characterized by asymptomatic infections, contact tracing undertaken by public health authorities is essential to identify potentially infected individuals.

Surveillance needs to be intensified in the local area contributing to the manhole site where any positive environmental sample is collected. The genetic analysis of this virus indicates it has been circulating for a considerable period before detection. Hence it is essential to strengthen poliovirus surveillance nationwide and ensure the health system is on high alert to promptly detect any new cases or ongoing transmission.

Immediate action should include notifying all national and subnational surveillance units about the poliovirus event. Rigorously sensitize all health-care workers on acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance requirements. Conduct community engagements and awareness activities to increase awareness of AFP and polio.

Increase the frequency of environmental surveillance sample collection in Lae City, Morobe province, from monthly to twice monthly in 3 existing sites and to consider expanding surveillance to additional sites within the city.

Vaccination:
In accordance with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) Standard Operating Procedures, preparations are underway in the country to launch a vaccination response using the oral polio vaccine type 2 (OPV2). All efforts should be implemented to increase population immunity and prevent poliovirus transmission to protect vulnerable populations, by identifying and vaccinating children with no history or incomplete immunization.

Routine immunization remains the cornerstone of polio eradication in alignment with the national childhood immunization schedule. The IPV provides a high level of individual immunity and effective protection against paralysis.

WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and/or trade to the Papua New Guinea on the basis of the information available for the current event.

Mexico's Ministry of Health on Thursday [22 May 2025] reported a total of 1629 confirmed cases of measles so far in 2025, as well as 4 deaths related to the outbreak, 3 of them in minors who had not been vaccinated.

The deaths occurred in states bordering the USA, where the current wave of infections comes from. In Chihuahua, a 7-year-old boy and an 11-month-old baby belonging to the Mennonite community, which usually refuses vaccination, [died]. The third death in that state also corresponds to a minor. In Sonora, a one-year-old baby died after presenting a severe case of malnutrition and not having received the measles vaccine.

The first case of the outbreak in Mexico was registered on 11 Apr [2025] in Chihuahua, in a 31-year-old man who was also unvaccinated. Since then, the disease has spread to 17 of the country's 32 states, mainly concentrated in Chihuahua, which has 1537 cases, followed by Sonora (30), Zacatecas (13), Tamaulipas (9), Coahuila (8), Durango (7), and Campeche (6).

The most recent report, with a cut-off to 21 May [2025], indicates that in just 24 hours, 47 new infections were confirmed. As for the most affected groups, children from 0 to 4 years of age have the highest incidence rate, with 3.41 cases per 100 000 children. Young adults between 25 and 34 years of age also stand out, with rates above 2 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in these age ranges.

This outbreak occurs in parallel to the rebound in cases in the USA, where more than 1000 infections and 3 deaths have already been recorded so far this year [2025]. Mexican health authorities insist on the urgency of completing vaccination schedules, especially in minors, to contain the spread of the virus.

Idaho health officials investigating measles exposure in Burley area
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Idaho's South Central Public Health District announced Friday [23 May 2025] that it is investigating a case of the extremely-contagious respiratory disease measles identified in an out-of-state resident who recently traveled to and spent time in Burley for a business trip. The announcement followed an April [2025] statement published by state epidemiologist Christine Hahn warning Idahoans that the USA has seen a dramatic rise in measles cases this year.

In the news release announcing its investigation, the South Central Public Health District stated that the hotel in which the infected person stayed is alerting its guests about the case using its communications system. The infected person during their infectious period visited the following list of places in Burley:

- 19 May 2025 -- EdgeWater Dining and Spirits at 530 Hampton Dr. between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m.
- 20 May 2025 -- Urgent Care of Idaho at 382 Overland Ave. between 8:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. (The Health District stated that this urgent care shares a waiting room with 2 other businesses. Spokeswoman Amy Dillon stated in an email to the Express that the agency did not identify the other 2 businesses by name because it was unable to reach the businesses before announcing its investigation.)
- 20 May 2025 -- Intermountain Health Cassia Regional Hospital at 1501 Hiland Ave. between 10 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.

Measles symptoms could appear in anyone who was exposed to the infected individual any time between 24 May and 14 Jun 2025, the Health District stated. 

""The investigation is ongoing, and people who may have been exposed are being notified by SCPHD and other health organizations,"" the Health District wrote. ""However, it is possible that some people who were exposed briefly would not have been identified by public health officials.""

Anyone who has been exposed should contact their health care provider right away and ""monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure,"" the Health District said. Anyone experiencing symptoms should call in advance before visiting any health care setting.

New Sandoval measles cases with possible Santa Fe exposure, health officials say
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Mexico health officials have reported 4 new measles cases in Sandoval County -- and warned some Santa Feans may have been exposed.

The new cases, which bring the Sandoval County total to 6 during the current outbreak and the total statewide to 78, are in an infant too young for vaccination and 3 adults, each with at least 1 dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, the state Department of Health said in a news release issued Friday afternoon [23 May 2025].

The agency listed the Walmart Supercenter on Herrera Drive and Presbyterian Santa Fe Medical Center's Emergency Department on Beckner Road as sites in the city where local people might have been exposed to the highly contagious illness Saturday morning [24 May 2025].

Out of the 78 cases in New Mexico so far, 12 have been in people who had gotten an MMR vaccine, Department of Health spokesperson David Morgan wrote in an email.

""Some vaccinated people may still get measles, mumps or rubella if they are exposed to the viruses,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website. ""It could be that their immune system didn't respond as well as they should have to the vaccine; their immune system's ability to fight the infection decreased over time; or they have prolonged, close contact with someone who has a virus.

""However,"" the site says, ""disease symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people. They are also less likely to spread the disease to other people.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2024, the Metropolitan City of Milan and surrounding areas in northern Italy (about 4 million people) experienced a measles epidemic caused by multiple introductions of different genotype D8 lineages, which led to small outbreaks, mostly linked to importation events and/or vulnerable population groups, without evidence of sustained local circulation [1]. As Subnational Reference Laboratory of the Italian measles and rubella surveillance network (MoRoNet), we now report a new surge of measles in the same area in 2025, driven by a unique lineage of genotype B3, causing locally acquired cases.

Measles surveillance activities in 2025
---------------------------------------
From January to April 2025, we investigated 42 suspected measles cases in the Metropolitan City of Milan and surrounding areas. Demographic and epidemiological data were collected through a standardised report form, epidemiological investigations were conducted by local public health authorities, and case definitions were applied according to the WHO guidelines [2]. Paired oropharyngeal swabs and urine samples were analysed by real-time RT-PCR [3], confirming measles infection in 32 cases. No differences between sexes were observed (18 males, 14 females), and the median age was 36.5 years (range: 1-48 years). Twelve cases were hospitalized, 2 with severe pneumonia. One case was in their last trimester of pregnancy. Two occupational cases likely contracted the infection in a healthcare setting. Seven of the 32 cases were vaccinated, with 1 individual vaccinated with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine. According to the epidemiological investigation, most (23/32) cases were reported as locally acquired (indigenous).

Measles viruses (MeV) from all confirmed cases were successfully genotyped by amplifying and sequencing the highly variable C-terminal region of the nucleoprotein coding gene (N-450) [4]. All sequences were deposited in GenBank (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank>) [5] and the WHO Measles Virus Nucleotide Surveillance (MeaNS2) database [6]. Identified strains were classified as genotype D8 (n = 5) and B3 (n = 27) (Figure 1). Genotype D8 strains showed identity between 97.6% and 100%, and clustered with sequences identified between 2021 and 2024 in Austria, Hungary, India, the Netherlands, Serbia, Romania and Russia. Genotype B3 strains showed identity between 99.3% and 100%, and clustered with sequences identified between 2022 and 2025 in Iran, Morocco and the Netherlands.

The 5 cases with D8 were detected between calendar weeks 2 and 14 2025. None of these cases was acquired locally: 4 had visited another Italian region or Romania and for 1 case, the source of infection was unknown. Overall, 3 distinct sequence identifiers (DSIds) were identified (5963, 8350 and 8996).

Ongoing circulation of a B3 lineage in Milan and surrounding areas
------------------------------------------------------------------
The B3 genotype was introduced into the area under surveillance in week 5 2025 in Province A by a case returning from travel (Case #1) (Table, Figure 2 [for tables/figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). In week 7 2025, we detected a locally acquired B3 case in the same area (Case #3), with no known direct link with Case #1 or other persons who experienced rash in the previous 7-21 days. From week 7 to week 17 2025, we identified 8 more measles cases in the same province. Overall, 3 small outbreaks involving 7 cases were observed (Table, Figure 2). The other 4 cases were reported as sporadic.

Starting from week 7 2025, we detected the same B3 lineage in the neighboring Province B (south of province A) in a case linked to a traveler (Case #2) and in a case with a history of travel (Case #4). Since week 9 2025, in the same province, we observed the spread of the B3 lineage among 11 locally acquired cases. We identified 5 small outbreaks (Table, Figure 2). Two additional imported cases (Cases #22 and #26) were detected in weeks 13 and 15 2025, in travellers. In week 12 2025, we confirmed 2 cases in the neighboring Province C (south of province A and north of province B, Cases #18 and #21).

By week 18 2025, 4 distinct sequence identifiers (DSIds) (6418, 8495, 8339 and 9418) were assigned, with 6418 the most prevalent. Four confirmed cases (#3, #4, #5 and #8) had attended mass gathering events in Province B in the 7-21 days before rash onset; of these, 2 lived in Province A and had no direct link with cases in Province B. Of the travel-associated cases, the countries involved were Egypt, France, Morocco and Spain.

Comparison with the 2024 measles epidemic activity
--------------------------------------------------
Although the number of fever and rash cases observed in the same months (January-April) in the area under surveillance in 2024 and 2025 were fairly similar (36 cases in 2024 vs. 42 cases in 2025), the laboratory-confirmed measles cases increased in 2025 nearly twofold compared with 2024 (32/42 in 2025 vs. 14/36 in 2024; Fisher's exact test (one-tailed); p value = 0.0009). Furthermore, while in 2024, 9 of 14 confirmed cases were travel-related, in 2025, most of the cases were reported as locally acquired (imported cases: 9/14 in 2025 vs. 9/32 in 2024; p value = 0.02) [1]. Lastly, the measles epidemiology in the first 4 months of 2024 was characterized by the co-circulation of three D8 lineages, while in 2025, measles epidemic activity was mainly sustained by a unique B3 lineage.

Discussion
----------
According to the most recent update by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Italy is among the 5 countries with the highest number of reported measles cases in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries [7]. In the WHO European Region, in 2024, the number of measles cases reached the highest level since 1997 [8]. Italy was among the most affected countries with 1097 cases [9] and lost its near-elimination status (< 10 cases per million population), with an incidence rate of 17.7 cases per million population [9-11].

Overall, the scenario of 2024 was characterised by the co-circulation of 5 D8 and 2 B3 lineages with different importation sources (unpublished data). Currently, the pattern of circulating MeV strains is characterised by the spread of a unique lineage of genotype B3, presumably representing a single chain of transmission [12], mostly sustained by locally acquired cases. This scenario is typical of countries experiencing reintroduction of measles, with the occurrence of outbreaks associated with a single genotype with nearly identical sequences [12]. The integration of thorough epidemiological investigation with molecular characterisation of outbreak strains suggested both multiple introductions in 2024 and uninterrupted transmission of a single B3 lineage in 2025 in and around the Metropolitan City of Milan.

Most cases were geographically and temporally clustered, with dates of rash onset occurring 7-21 days apart, suggesting the presence of an epidemiological pathway [2]. A measles lineage that propagated continuously for a prolonged period in a given area raises concerns about the potential re-establishment of endemic transmission.

In line with national data [10], the ongoing outbreak is affecting mainly unvaccinated young adults and adults. The high vaccination coverage in Lombardy, the region surrounding Milan, currently 96.06% and 93.63% for the 1st and 2nd dose, respectively, has successfully limited transmission in younger age groups. The cases described here are within pockets of susceptible individuals, who were not exposed to natural infection due to the absence of considerable epidemic circulation and did not receive the vaccine either because immunisation was not yet mandatory or was not widely offered during their childhood. It is therefore crucial to implement immunisation catch-up programmes, as recommended by local and national authorities (Regional regulation number G1.2024.0004194, 6 Feb 2024) [10].

Almost all the N-450 sequences of B3 measles strains identified in the area under surveillance in 2025 are identical to a B3 strain circulating in Morocco in 2024-2025, where a large measles outbreak is ongoing [13,14]. French public health authorities have recently reported a notable increase in measles cases with a history of travel to Morocco since the start of the year [2025] [15]. We identified only 2 returning travellers from Morocco and 1 from France, suggesting that the circulating B3 lineage became established in Milan and surrounding areas, causing cases locally.

The genetic characterisation of the circulating MeVs, integrated with case-based epidemiological investigation, provides valuable insight into transmission dynamics. In our context, this led to the identification of the introduction of a B3 lineage that spread in and around Milan, giving rise to an ongoing episode of uninterrupted transmission from a genetic standpoint. Although we have hypothesised a single chain of measles transmission, we cannot exclude the possibility that some cases with a history of travel may have gone undetected by the surveillance system, resulting in missing links between the identified cases.

Endemic transmission is defined by the WHO as a chain of transmission that circulates continuously in a given area for more than 12 months [16]. While we have not yet reached that threshold, the current pattern is worrisome and warrants remaining vigilant to avoid the potential re-establishment of endemic transmission. As recently highlighted by the ECDC, considering the seasonality of measles, cases may continue to increase in the coming months [17].

Conclusion
----------
The Metropolitan City of Milan and the surrounding areas are experiencing a surge in the number of measles cases driven by a single genotype B3 lineage, primarily affecting unvaccinated adults. Our findings raise concerns about the potential return of measles as an endemic disease, underscoring the urgent need to implement all necessary countermeasures (i.e. close immunity gaps, maintain high-quality surveillance) to prevent this scenario from becoming a reality.

Unvaccinated traveler infected with measles may have exposed people at DIA, nearby hotel last week, CDPHE says
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An unvaccinated individual infected with measles who arrived at DIA from an international flight before staying for the night at a nearby hotel and boarding a domestic flight the next morning may have exposed thousands of people to the highly contagious virus last week, state health officials said Thursday [22 May 2025].

The individual arrived at Gate A-27 in concourse A at 5:10 p.m. on Tuesday, 13 May 2025, walked across the bridge to international customs, and picked up their bag at the international baggage claim 3 on the main terminal, according to officials from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE). The unvaccinated traveler then rode the Quality Inn and Suites shuttle to the Quality Inn and Suites Denver International Airport hotel at around 6 p.m. before checking in and riding the elevator to their room.

State health officials said the infected person spent the night at the hotel and checked out the next morning, leaving the hotel at around 5 a.m. before taking the hotel's shuttle to the airport, where they arrived about 30 minutes later. The individual then passed through the main terminal, the train to the gates, and concourse B before boarding a flight that took off from Gate B-86 at around 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 14 May 2025.

Dates and locations of potential exposure:

CDPHE officials said Thursday [22 May 2025] the individual may have exposed thousands of people at the airport between 5-8 p.m. on Tuesday, 13 May 2025, and between 5:30-10 a.m. on Wednesday, 14 May 2025.

Inside the shuttle to and from the Quality Inn and Suites hotel near DIA, the unvaccinated traveler may have exposed people between 6-8 p.m. on Tuesday, 13 May 2025, and between 5-7:30 a.m. on Wednesday, 14 May 2025.

At the hotel, guests could have been exposed between 6:15 p.m. on Tuesday, 13 May 2025, to 7 a.m. on Wednesday, 14 May 2025.

While interactions with other people may have been brief, measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads through the air and can remain airborne for up to 2 hours -- meaning the individual may have exposed thousands of others to the virus, even if they were nowhere near the infected person at the time, state health officials said.

""This situation underscores the critical importance of vaccination. Staying up to date on vaccinations and being aware of health risks when traveling are important ways to protect yourself and your community,"" Dr. Rachel Herlihy, the state epidemiologist and deputy chief medical officer at the CDPHE, said in a statement Thursday [22 May 2025].

Herlihy said the CDPHE was working ""swiftly"" to identify and notify anyone who may have been exposed. She added anyone who was exposed to the case on either of the flights will be notified directly by their state or local public health agency.

Anyone who believes they may have been exposed -- especially those who have not been vaccinated with the MMR vaccine -- should monitor for symptoms for 21 days and avoid public gatherings or high-risk settings, health officials said in the news release.

Symptoms to watch out for include anything from a fever, a cough, a runny nose, and red, watery eyes that develop into a rash that starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body about 3 to 5 days after symptoms first start. A person with measles is contagious 4 days before and 4 days after the rash appears.

While most people recover within 2 to 3 weeks after contracting the virus, unvaccinated people run the risk of complications from the disease, including ear infections, seizures, pneumonia, immune amnesia, brain damage and ultimately, death.

If you were at these locations during the exposure window and develop symptoms, the CDPHE asks that you immediately contact your health care provider by phone before trying to seek treatment to avoid other people from becoming potentially infected with the virus. If you do not have a provider, call an urgent care center or emergency department and explain that you may have been exposed to measles.

The CDPHE said people who are susceptible to measles and were exposed either at the airport or the nearby hotel may develop symptoms through Wednesday, 4 Jun 2025.

First confirmed case of measles reported in Iowa since 2019. Here's what we know:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An unvaccinated adult in central Iowa has tested positive for measles, marking the 1st confirmed case of the highly contagious respiratory virus in the state since 2019, the state Department of Health and Human Services said.

Iowa HHS wrote in a release Friday, 23 May 2025, that the person's case tested positive through the State Hygienic Laboratory. The state hasn't released the identity of the person who tested positive, nor where they are from. No widespread public exposure is expected through the case, and an investigation has been completed.

Iowa is among 31 states that have confirmed measles cases involved in a growing nationwide outbreak that has totaled 1046 cases, including 3 deaths because of the illness in 2025, according to CDC data as of 22 May 2025.

State Medical Director Robert Kruse said in the 23 May 2025 release that the best tool to prevent measles is the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. 

""Getting vaccinated not only protects you but also protects people in your community who can't get vaccinated, like infants too young to begin the series and those who are immunosuppressed,"" Kruse said. ""We ask Iowans to review their vaccination records and medical records to ensure they are protected and to reach out to their healthcare provider if they have questions.""

There have been no measles cases reported in the state since 2019, according to state public health officials. A major outbreak occurred that year, resulting in measles cases nationwide. Iowa has had sporadic measles cases over the years but has avoided major outbreaks in recent memory.

However, growing vaccine hesitancy nationwide has helped contribute to a dramatically changing landscape for states. The World Health Organization declared measles eliminated in the United States in 2000, but in the years since, the disease has reemerged nationwide with more frequency in recent years.

In 2024, 84% of 2-year-olds and nearly 86% of adolescents between the ages of 13 and 15 had completed the 2-dose MMR vaccine series, according to state public health data. The CDC estimates approximately 89% of kindergartners in Iowa were fully vaccinated against measles during the 2023-24 school year. Van Liew said Polk County has seen consistent declines of fully vaccinated school-aged children since 2018.

School immunization reports for the 2023-24 school year show about 6% of all students in Polk County, or about 5500 students, were not fully vaccinated. That's compared with 2600 students in the 2018-19 school year. Van Liew said the county has seen those rates increase in nonpublic schools, where about 88% of students are fully vaccinated.

Less than a month after the 1st case of measles was reported in the state, North Dakota is reporting 21 people infected with the disease.

Grand Forks County reported its first 2 cases Friday [23 May 2025], joining Cass and Williams counties as the 3 to report the disease in the state. Cass County reported 2 more cases Friday [23 May 2025], bringing the total to 6. Williams County remains steady with 13 cases.

The cases in Grand Forks County are related to international travel, according to a release from the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services. All cases involve unvaccinated individuals. One person in Cass County has been hospitalized.

One person with measles was contagious when flying into Williston, the release said. The public may have been exposed on United Airlines Flight 5293 from Denver to Williston on Wednesday, 14 May 2025, and at the Williston Basin International Airport between 10:22 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. that day [14 May 2025], according to the release.

""It is essential that individuals without immunity stay home and avoid contact with others for 21 days following exposure,"" said Molly Howell, immunization director at North Dakota Health and Human Services.

Massachusetts health officials warn of potential exposure to hepatitis A after infection in food service worker
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), Barnstable County Department of Health and Environment, and the Provincetown Board of Health are alerting anyone who dined at The Red Inn at 15 Commercial Street in Provincetown between 30 Apr 2025 and 15 May 2025 that they may have been exposed to hepatitis A and should contact their healthcare provider.

A food service employee of the restaurant who worked during those dates has a confirmed infection with hepatitis A virus. Customers who could have been exposed to the virus are being advised to contact their health careprovider and receive appropriate medical treatment for a possible exposure to hepatitis A. Preventive measures such as hepatitis A vaccine and hepatitis A immune globulin are generally only effective at preventing hepatitis A infection if given within 2 weeks of exposure, prior to symptom onset.

The early signs and symptoms of hepatitis A are fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice (dark urine, yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes). The illness varies in severity, with mild cases lasting 2 weeks or less and more severe cases lasting 4 to 6 weeks or longer. Some individuals, especially children, may not develop jaundice and may have an illness so mild that it can go unnoticed. However, even mildly ill persons can still be highly infectious. People with illness suggestive of hepatitis should consult a health care provider even if symptoms are mild.

Hepatitis A virus is spread as a result of fecal contamination (fecal-oral route) and may be spread from person-to-person through close contact or through food handling. The virus can be spread by contaminated food and beverages.

Customers who dined at The Red Inn between 30 Apr 2025 and 15 May 2025 are urged to be particularly thorough in handwashing after toileting and prior to food preparation to avoid any potential further spread of disease. Handwashing should include vigorous soaping of the hands, including the back of the hands, wrists, between fingers and under fingernails. Hands should be thoroughly rinsed.

Hepatitis A vaccine has been recommended as part of childhood immunizations since 1991, so people 34 years and younger may have been previously vaccinated. Those who dined at the restaurant between 30 Apr 2025 and 15 May 2025 are urged to confirm their vaccination status with their provider.

After returning to Taiwan, he developed symptoms such as headache, muscle aches and runny nose on 16 May 2025, followed by a rash. After reporting the medical problem, the patient was admitted to a negative pressure isolation ward for treatment.

Measles is an acute, highly contagious disease caused by the measles virus. Humans are the only host, and the disease can be transmitted through air, droplets, contact, etc. Droplets containing measles virus can remain suspended in the air for more than 2 hours and can be easily spread in public places, especially in spring.

Typical measles symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis (photophobia, tearing, red eyes), etc. in the early stages of infection, which are difficult to distinguish from a cold. At this time, white spots (Koplik spots) will appear on the inner mucosa of the mouth. 

After the patient's rash subsides, dark spots or peeling will remain on the skin surface. A small number of patients may develop complications (otitis media or encephalitis).

To confirm whether they are infected with measles, a blood test for measles antibodies is required. Usually, people who have had measles once will have measles antibodies for life.

Measles vaccine is the only effective way to prevent measles. After the injection, the human body will produce protective antibodies in about 2 weeks.

Vaccination at public expense:
1. Infants aged 12 months or above and children aged 5 years or above who are about to enter school.
2. General women of childbearing age (15-49 years old): Those who have a negative report of rubella antibody test within the past 3 months.
3. Postpartum booster vaccination: If a woman does not have rubella antibody during pregnancy, she must provide a rubella antibody test report within 2 years from the date of the test for that pregnancy.

Self-paid vaccination:
1. Infants and young children aged 6 months to 1 year who plan to travel to areas with measles or rubella outbreaks.
2. Adults born after 1966 who are not immune to measles or rubella are recommended to receive one dose of the vaccine at their own expense. For example, those whose job nature requires frequent contact with foreigners, medical care workers, and staff of institutions caring for infants and young children who have not yet received the 1st dose of MMR vaccine.
3. Before going abroad, you can also go to the ""Travel Medicine Clinic"" of a domestic and international vaccination contract hospital for evaluation and vaccination.

Li Yiqing, a laboratory technician at the Taipei Veterans Affairs Taitung Branch, said that in the face of the measles epidemic, people need to confirm whether they are at high risk of infection. If they suspect they have come into contact with a measles patient, they should go to the hospital within 72 hours, inform the relevant contact history, and assess whether they need to be vaccinated. Li Yiqing emphasized that ""prevention is better than cure"". People can improve their immunity through a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and maintaining a happy mood, and have sufficient protection. Therefore, we do not need to panic about measles.

If the public has any concerns about measles, please visit: <https://ntshb.tw/hc03MvQrA>. You can also call the epidemic prevention hotline 1922 or contact the Taipei Headquarters Taitung Branch at 089-222995 extension 5053 for professional service.

Unconfirmed number of children have been confirmed dead in Mbutu Community in Aboh Mbaise local government area [LGA] of Imo State due to outbreak of diphtheria.

Chairman of Aboh Mbaise LGA, Barr. Iheukwumere Henry Alaribe, confirmed the death of the children in a statement dated 26 May 2025.

Diphtheria is caused by a toxin-producing bacterium called _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_. The bacteria usually infects the nose and throat but can also affect the skin, and spreads through the air via respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing, or through direct contact with infected individuals or contaminated objects.

Already, the local government chairman has ordered temporary closure of schools in Mbutu as a control mechanism to checkmate the spread.

Spokesperson to the chairman, Godspower Dike, said diphtheria has claimed lives of the children less than a week after its outbreak. He added that parents have been instructed to keep their children indoors to prevent infection.

According to the chairman, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Department of Disease Prevention and Control in the Imo State Ministry of Health, along with health workers from Aboh Mbaise LGA, were working round the clock to investigate and contain the spread of the unusual disease.

According to him, an isolation center has been established at Mbutu Health Center while health workers have been deployed to quarantine children who may have been exposed to the disease, and to ensure the well-being of the community.

He appealed to parents to immediately vaccinate their children to help protect them.

""In light of this outbreak, parents who have not yet vaccinated their children are strongly urged to do so without delay. Vaccinations are crucial for preventing the spread of diseases and protecting our children's health,"" the chairman appealed.

The statement further appealed to the public to remain calm and cooperate with relevant organisations to control the outbreak.

""We encourage the public to remain calm and cooperate with the relevant authorities as we work to control this outbreak. Updates will be provided as more information becomes available"", Dike said.

Health Alert! Whooping cough outbreak in Loreto leaves 9 dead and 490 confirmed cases
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Loreto region is going through a serious health situation after a new outbreak of pertussis (whooping cough) that has left, so far, 9 people dead and 490 confirmed cases, according to information from the Center for Disease Prevention and Control of the Regional Health Management (Geresa).

The Geresa specialist, Carlos Ãlvarez, announced that the province hardest hit by the outbreak is Datem del MaraÃ±Ã³n, where most of the fatalities have been registered. The highly contagious disease is still active in the region with 10 ongoing outbreaks, which has raised concerns among health authorities.

Among the areas with the highest number of infections is the district of Punchana, with 18 confirmed cases, followed by Iquitos and San Juan, with 8 cases each, and BelÃ©n with 4 cases.

In view of the advance of the outbreak, the regional authorities have reinforced control actions, prioritizing epidemiological surveillance, timely detection of cases and the intensification of vaccination campaigns.

Ãlvarez urges the population not to lower their guard and to go immediately to the nearest health facility in the event of symptoms such as persistent cough, shortness of breath or fever. He stressed the importance of completing the childhood vaccination schedule and maintaining preventive measures such as hand washing, the use of a mask in case of respiratory symptoms and avoiding contact with vulnerable people.

For his part, the infectious disease doctor at the Regional Hospital of Loreto, Juan Carlos Celis, said that the pertussis bacterium can be deadly, especially in the vulnerable population, children and the elderly. ""This disease is highly contagious because of coughing. However, it is preventable by the vaccine. In this sense, it questions the fact that in remote native communities they have not carried out immunization, with only 40% of the population having access to a preventive vaccine,"" Celis said.

Faced with the alert of cases of whooping cough in the Yamakay Entza area of the district of Cahuapanas, province of Datem del MaraÃ±Ã³n, the Regional Government of Loreto, through the Geresa Loreto, began coordination with the Ministry of Health (Minsa) and the Ministry of Defense to achieve the transfer of a team of health professionals to the site.

Vaccination plea after measles cases surge in Scotland
------------------------------------------------------
Health chiefs are warning of the risks of measles after more cases were recorded in Scotland in the first 5 months of the year [2025] than the whole of 2024. The latest figures, to be published on Thursday [29 May 2025] could show more cases of the highly infectious disease, which is on the rise around the world.

Two years ago there was just one case of measles in Scotland, but in 2024 that rose to 24 laboratory-confirmed cases. That figure was exceeded by 14 May this year [2025] and, although the numbers remain small, health experts are concerned that low vaccination rates in some areas could lead to many more cases.

Measles is a highly contagious disease which is spread by coughs and sneezes. The virus can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said children under the age of 5 accounted for more than 40% of the cases reported in Europe and central Asia. In March 2025, it reported that the number of measles cases in Europe was at its highest level for 25 years.

WHO regional director Henri Kluge called it a ""wake-up call."" ""Without high vaccination rates, there is no health security,"" he said.

Helen Benson, consultant in public health for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said there had been an increase in cases across Scotland. ""We have already seen more this year [2025] than the whole of last year [2024],"" she said. ""In Glasgow we have seen several cases since the start of the year and in recent weeks we have seen a small number within the Govanhill area.

""We are potentially aware that there may be some transmission in the local community so our efforts now are to minimise the number of further cases."" She said the health board was focusing its campaign on increasing levels of the MMR vaccine in the area.

Health experts [say] the vaccine -- which immunises people against measles, mumps and rubella -- is 97% effective in fighting off the dangerous virus. Uptake in Scotland remains high, with 90% of children having 2 doses by the age of 6. However, WHO recommends at least 95% of children are vaccinated.

Across Scotland vaccination rates have fallen slightly in recent years with public health officials believing vaccine fatigue or misinformation plays a role. Govanhill, one of the most diverse areas of Scotland, is one of several areas in Glasgow that has lower MMR vaccination rates.

Ms Benson said: ""We've got a population that speaks many languages. For many, English is not the first language. So sometimes that has meant they may have had difficulty engaging with the NHS.""

She said the health board had launched a communication campaign across several languages and was using community peer workers to encourage people to take up the opportunity of any MMR vaccinations they may have missed.

""Measles can be a very serious infection,"" Ms Benson said. ""Approximately 1 in 5 cases end up in hospital. Many of those may require intensive care, and it can lead to lifelong complications, for example, hearing loss, sight loss and inflammation of the brain.""

She said some people were more susceptible to complications from measles than others, including small babies under the age of 1, pregnant women and people with immunosuppression. ""It is important to get the vaccine not just for yourself but for the people around you,"" she said.

Nebraska has first confirmed measles case this year
---------------------------------------------------
Nebraska health officials have confirmed the state's first measles case in almost a decade. The case was reported to the Panhandle Public Health District (PPHD), which covers 12 counties in the western region of the state, as well as the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. PPHD Health Director Jessica Davies said in a written statement the confirmed measles case is in an ""age-appropriately vaccinated child"" in Sheridan County.

The department said some people may have been exposed at the Family Dollar in Rushville on May 17 [2025] from 9 a.m. to noon, at the Little Lambs Preschool track meet on May 20, and on May 21 at the Gordon Clinic from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.

Davies said the child has had mild symptoms and is recovering from the illness. Since the family did not report any out-of-state travel, health officials said this could indicate potential community spread and they emphasize the importance of being up to date on the measles/mumps/rubella, or MMR vaccine. One dose of the vaccine is about 93% effective at preventing measles, while 2 doses are about 97% effective.

Dr. David Quimby, an infectious disease physician with CHI Health-Creighton and Medical Director of Infection Prevention & Infectious Diseases for the CommonSpirit Health Midwest Division, said it is likely this is not the only active case of measles in the state.

""If there is one patient in Nebraska who did not leave the state and is infected, there are more, because they got infected from somebody,"" he said in a press conference following the announcement of the confirmed case. He added the best way to stay safe from contracting measles is getting the MMR vaccine.

This is the first confirmed measles case in Nebraska since 2017, but measles cases across the country have been increasing in 2025, with more than 1000 confirmed so far. Most of those are related to an outbreak in Texas, but there have been dozens of cases in Kansas, as well as cases in Missouri and Colorado. Iowa also reported a case last week, its first since 2019, in an unvaccinated adult.

Two-thirds of the cases nationwide have been in those ages 19 and younger. About 12% of the cases have required hospitalization and there have been 3 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

[This is the first case of measles reported from Nebraska since 2017, but since there was no out-of-state travel, it is an autochthonous (locally acquired) case so additional undiagnosed cases were likely. Recently (Measles - Peru: ex USA 20250514.8724311), ProMED posted on a case of measles that was travel-related and allegedly acquired in Nebraska, but the link was not confirmed to have occurred, at least from a resident of Nebraska.

This Nebraska case was reported to be ""age-appropriately immunized"" against measles but it is unclear, since no age is given, whether the child had received 1 or 2 doses. Although vaccine failures can occur in twice-immunized persons, most do not transmit to others, but the following report documents secondary transmission from an immunized person:

Rosen JB, Rota JS, Hickman CJ, et al: Outbreak of measles among persons with prior evidence of immunity, New York City, 2011. Clin Infect Dis. 2014;58:1205-1210. <https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciu105>.

Abstract
-------
""Background: Measles was eliminated in the United States through high vaccination coverage and a public health system able to rapidly respond to measles. Measles may occur among vaccinated individuals, but secondary transmission from such individuals has not been documented.

""Methods: Suspected patients and contacts exposed during a measles outbreak in New York City in 2011 were investigated. Medical histories and immunization records were obtained. Cases were confirmed by detection of measles-specific immunoglobulin M and/or RNA. Tests for measles immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG avidity, measurement of measles neutralizing antibody titers, and genotyping were performed to characterize the cases.

""Results: The index patient had 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine; of 88 contacts, 4 secondary patients were confirmed who had either 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine or a past positive measles IgG antibody. All patients had laboratory confirmation of measles infection, clinical symptoms consistent with measles, and high-avidity IgG antibody characteristic of a secondary immune response. Neutralizing antibody titers of secondary patients reached >80 000 mIU/mL 3-4 days after rash onset and that of the index was <500 mIU/mL 9 days after rash onset. No additional cases of measles occurred among 231 contacts of secondary patients.

""Conclusions: This is the first report of measles transmission from a twice-vaccinated individual with documented secondary vaccine failure. The clinical presentation and laboratory data of the index patient were typical of measles in a naive individual. Secondary patients had robust anamnestic antibody responses. No tertiary cases occurred despite numerous contacts. This outbreak underscores the need for thorough epidemiologic and laboratory investigation of suspected cases of measles regardless of vaccination status."" - Mod.LL]

---------------------------------------------------------------
A second case of measles was confirmed in Williamson County on Tuesday [27 May 2025]. The Williamson County and Cities Health District (WCCHD) says this case involves an unvaccinated adult in Leander. The person is no longer in the infectious period and was not in the Williamson County area while they were contagious. Last Thursday [22 May 2025], the first measles case was confirmed in the county, in a school-aged child from Leander.

In collaboration with the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), local health authorities are notifying individuals who may have been exposed. WCCHD, DSHS, and local agencies are working to identify and assess potential contacts as part of the ongoing public health investigation.

Marquette County Health Department reports measles case
-------------------------------------------------------
Marquette County Health Department (MCHD) has confirmed a measles case in a Marquette County resident, according to a Thursday [29 May 2025] release. This is the first measles case in the Upper Peninsula (UP) in 2025. The MCHD says it's the first measles case in the county in 30 years.

The MCHD says it is working closely with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to investigate the situation and prevent additional cases. Click here for statewide measles case information: <https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/adult-child-serv/childrenfamilies/immunizations/measlesupdates>.

Because the measles virus can remain infectious in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person leaves the area, individuals who were present at the following locations may have been exposed:

- Moonspun Wool - 219 W. Washington, Marquette, MI 49855
Monday, May 19, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Tuesday, May 20, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and
Wednesday, May 21, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

- Marquette Food Co-op - 502 W. Washington, Marquette, MI 49855
Tuesday, May 20 from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.

- Midas - 2192 US 41, Marquette, MI 49855
Wednesday, May 21, from 12-2:30 p.m.

Anyone who has visited these locations during the stated timeframes should contact MCHD at 906-475-9977 and monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days. If any symptoms develop, stay away from others and call ahead to inform them about your potential measles exposure before visiting a doctor, urgent care, or emergency room so they can take precautions to avoid exposing others.

The MCHD says measles is so contagious that 90% of non-immune people who are exposed to measles will become infected. In general, individuals with 2 appropriately spaced doses of the measles vaccine are considered immune. Additionally, adults born before 1957 or with evidence of prior measles illness are considered immune.

With the risk of community spread, anyone not fully vaccinated against measles is encouraged to do so as soon as possible. Contact your health care provider if you have questions regarding your status of immunity to measles or MCHD at 906-475-9977 for assistance in locating vaccination records.

According to data from the Michigan Care Improvement Registry, as of December 31, 2024, only 57% of children 19-35 months of age were up to date with all recommended vaccines. This means that nearly half of Michigan toddlers are not fully protected from vaccine-preventable diseases.

Parents can contact their child's health care provider to find out which vaccines are needed to ensure their child stays protected.

Health officials report 2 more cases of measles in Montana
----------------------------------------------------------
Two more measles cases have been confirmed in Montana. One case in Hill County exposed others in the community.

Hill County public health officials announced late last week that a local child is isolating after they contracted measles. In a press release, the health department said it was unclear where they became infected.

It said the child also exposed an unknown number of people at a private gathering. The county is holding an accelerated measles vaccine clinic to help prevent further spread.

Gallatin County officials also announced a ninth measles case. The health department is still investigating where that individual became infected. Previous cases were tied to out-of-state exposure.

Health officials are reminding the public the best way to avoid measles is by getting vaccinated. Two doses of an MMR vaccine prevent measles infections 97% of the time, according to federal health officials.

Flathead County Confirms Second Measles Case
--------------------------------------------
Health officials on Thursday [29 May 2025], confirmed a second case of measles in an adult Flathead County resident who reported traveling outside of Montana recently. While the 2 known cases appear unrelated, health officials determined the first individual was fully vaccinated, while the status of the second infected person is unknown.

The Flathead City-County Health Department (FCCHD) released a statement saying ""there is no clear indication of the exact point of exposure and there is no connection with the previous case reported in Flathead County""; however, the health department's disease investigation team has determined 2 locations of public exposure, both at Logan Health facilities in Kalispell.

FCCHD recommends that anyone who visited the following locations only during the specified dates and times may have been exposed to measles,"" according to the statement, which describes locations including the Logan Health building known as ""The Rock,"" located at 350 Heritage Way in Kalispell, and the Logan Health Emergency Department, located at 350 Conway Drive in Kalispell.

Anyone who visited The Rock on Friday, May 23 [2025], between 2:40 p.m. and 5:30 p.m., or its associated health clinics -- Heart and Lung; Hematology and Oncology; Orthopedics and Sports Medicine-Heritage; and Urology -- may have been exposed. Anyone who visited the Logan Health Emergency Department on Monday, May 26, between 6:40 p.m. and 9:10 p.m. also may have been exposed.

Those who may have been exposed can use the health department's measles exposure self-assessment tool to help determine their next steps.

The individual who contracted the area's second known measles case is an adult and is currently isolating at home following recent hospitalization for the illness, according to Health Officer Jen Rankosky. It brings the total number of measles cases in Montana to 13, and the number of hospitalizations to 2.

All 13 cases of measles are Montana residents of 3 counties: Flathead, Hill and Gallatin. ""Any additional confirmed measles cases and associated exposure locations in Flathead County will be posted on the health department's website moving forward,"" Rankosky said. In an email, Rankosky said officials have confirmed that the first individual's vaccination records indicate they are fully vaccinated.

""However, the vaccination status of the second person remains unknown, as there are no existing records confirming whether they have been vaccinated or not,"" Rankosky said. ""The state is currently investigating and working to obtain records from another state, as this individual was not originally from here. This process may take some time to ensure the accuracy of the information.""

Measles cases rise to 64 in Kansas, expand to additional county
---------------------------------------------------------------
The number of counties reporting positive cases of measles expanded to 11 over the weekend and comes as the number of cases in the state continue to grow, according the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE). Over the weekend, the KDHE and the Pawnee County Health Department reported a positive case of the highly contagious disease involving a resident there.

It was unknown if the case is associated with the ongoing outbreak in southwest Kansas, the KDHE said. The number of measles cases reported in the state now stands at 64, up from 56 cases 2 weeks ago, according to data from KDHE's 2025 Kansas Measles Case Data dashboard. The vast majority of the cases, 59, are related to the outbreak concentrated in the southwestern part of Kansas. The number of cases known to be related to the outbreak increased by 5 over the past 2 weeks. There have been 3 hospitalizations and no deaths connected to the outbreak.

Measles cases have been reported in 8 counties in that area: Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray, Haskell, Kiowa, Morton and Stevens counties. Elsewhere, measles case as have been reported in Pawnee, Reno and Sedgwick counties. Children, teens make up majority of cases in Kansas Children and teens account for the vast majority of cases, with 22 involving children 4 years and younger, 18 involving children between 5 and 10, 7 involving children between 11 and 13, and 4 between 14 and 17. The remaining 12 cases include people 18 and older.

The data shows that overall, white patients account for 63 of the cases. The race of remaining patient is unknown. Of the cases where race is listed as White, 58 are listed as being not Hispanic or Latino, 5 are listed as Hispanic or Latino and one is listed as unknown. Overall vaccination rates are not provided. For the cases related to the outbreak in southwest Kansas, only 5 cases involve patients who had been appropriately vaccinated. The majority of cases, 51, involve patients who were not vaccinated, not fully vaccinated for their age, or received a dose after being exposed to measles. Three cases involved patients who could not verify their vaccination status.

Pertussis in Peru: 12 deaths and 650 infections registered in 2025
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (Minsa) in the face of the worst outbreak of pertussis (whooping cough), a disease that so far in 2025 has 12 deaths and 650 infected, is guaranteeing the intensification of vaccination to prevent the spread of this disease, especially in the Peruvian Jungle.

Cases have skyrocketed in Peru and we are facing the largest outbreak in the last decade. The National Center for Epidemiology, Prevention and Control of Diseases (CDC Peru) of the Ministry of Health (Minsa) has updated data until epidemiological week 20.

These register more than 650 cumulative cases of this infectious disease, which far exceed the annual peaks of the last 6 years. ""In 2020, 2021 and 2022, annual cases rarely exceeded 150; today, less than halfway through the year [2025], that figure has more than quadrupled,"" they report.

Pertussis cases present with confirmed and suspected cases. Those confirmed in Loreto are 400 cases, Lima registers 42, Cajamarca 22, Cusco 17, Arequipa 12, Callao 12, Tacna 9 and in Lambayeque only 22 suspects. The deaths have been registered, 9 in the Loreto region, especially in the Datem del MaraÃ±Ã³n, 1 in Metropolitan Lima and 2 in Lambayeque.

Most deaths have occurred in children aged 0 to 4 years and a 40-year-old male. The disease has a higher incidence in the youngest; 119 cases have also been registered in children aged 5 to 9 years.

In most cases, minors did not have the complete vaccination schedule, when it is children under 2 years of age who are at greater risk of developing a serious condition and dying from whooping cough, warned the director of CDC Peru, CÃ©sar Munayco.

Parents should make sure their children get the pentavalent vaccine, which protects against pertussis. It is applied at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, with a booster between 18 months and 4 years. It is also recommended to vaccinate pregnant women in the third trimester when you can transfer antibodies to the newborn before they receive their first dose.

But, according to the Ministry of Health's information dashboard, so far in May 2025, only 3.1% of children have received the third dose recorded, this being the lowest value of 2025 to date.

In Loreto, one of the regions most affected by the outbreak, it has a vaccination coverage of 27.2%. Puno barely 25.5%, which is the lowest figure in Peru, which is worrying because according to Minsa graphs there are weekly peaks that are close to 70 reports, of which a large part have probable diagnoses, which could further increase the final number of infections.

Currently, molecular tests to detect pertussis are mainly processed in Lima, although Minsa plans to decentralize this capacity to the regions. However, sanitary blockade actions are activated immediately in the event of any suspicious case, without waiting for laboratory results.

Second child dies of measles in Mongolia's capital
--------------------------------------------------
A second child in Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, has died from measles amid a growing number of cases, according to the country's National Centre for Communicable Diseases (NCCD) on Friday [30 May 2025]. The patient, 9 months old, was admitted to the centre this week in critical condition and succumbed to the disease on Friday morning [30 May 2025], the NCCD said in a statement.

In view of this, the NCCD urged parents to pay attention to the symptoms of measles at an early stage among their children and seek emergency medical care immediately, Xinhua news agency reported.

According to the WHO, measles is a highly contagious viral disease transmitted by respiratory droplets and direct contact. Measles spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications, and even death.

Measles can affect anyone, but it is most common in children. Measles infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body.

Any non-immune person (not vaccinated or vaccinated but did not develop immunity) can become infected. Unvaccinated young children and pregnant women are at the highest risk of severe measles complications.

Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus.

Before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every 2 to 3 years and caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year. An estimated 107 500 people died from measles in 2023, mostly children under the age of 5 years, despite the availability of safe and cost-effective vaccines.

Pakistan's polio case count for 2025 has risen to 10, with 2 new cases reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. (K-P). Despite ongoing vaccination efforts, access limitations and a shortage of female vaccinators have left thousands of children vulnerable, particularly in southern K-P. The absence of effective door-to-door immunisation in certain areas has led to dangerous immunity gaps.

Notably, Union Council Bakhmal Ahmad Zai in Lakki Marwat missed recent rounds of vaccination, while UC Saintanga in Bannu has not had a full campaign since October 2023. These lapses have heightened the risk of transmission.

To counter this, a nationwide campaign is set to begin on 26 May [2025], targeting over 45 million children under the age of 5 across 159 districts. The campaign aims to close immunity gaps and reach high-risk areas. Its success hinges on addressing challenges such as recruiting sufficient female vaccinators, strengthening monitoring, improving access, and engaging communities in the importance of vaccination.

With collective effort, Pakistan can progress towards a polio-free future. The upcoming campaign is a crucial step in that direction.

7th measles case reported in Arkansas
-------------------------------------
Another measles case has been reported in Faulkner County, bringing the total number of measles cases in Arkansas since early April 2025 to 7, a spokesperson for the state Department of Health said Wednesday [28 May 2025].

The spokesperson, Ashley Whitlow, said the latest reported infection -- like all of the previously reported cases in the state in 2025 except one -- was of a minor. She declined to say whether the latest minor who was infected had been vaccinated.

Unlike for most of the previous cases, the Health Department did not list on its website any locations where the infected minor had recently visited, which Whitlow said was because outbreak response nurses were able to identify everyone who may have been exposed to the minor while the minor was infectious.

""If there is a location where we can't identify or get in contact with every person who was there, then we will post it on the website,"" Whitlow said.

The department has recommended that people residing in or traveling to Faulkner County or surrounding counties get a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine if they have not. The 1st dose of the vaccine is recommended at age 12 to 15 months and the 2nd at 4 to 5 years of age.

People who have received the vaccine or were born before 1957 are generally considered immune, according to the department.

Health Department officials on 10 Apr 2025 announced the state's first 2 measles cases since 2018. Both were unvaccinated minors, one of them from Saline County and one of them from Faulkner County, health officials said at the time.

Since then, the department has reported one other case in Saline County, and the rest have been from Faulkner County. The department's website, however, on Wednesay [28 May 2025', listed a total of 6 cases in Faulkner County and one in Saline County.

Attempts by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette to clarify the discrepancy with the department were unsuccessful on Wednesday [28 May 2025].

The department has previously indicated both Saline County cases were of minors who had recently traveled outside the state.

In Faulkner County, however, the department has said the virus appears to be spreading within the community, prompting the department to hold a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine clinic in Conway on 13 May 2025.

Bay Area health agencies warn of potential measles exposure
-----------------------------------------------------------
Two Bay Area health departments are warning of several possible exposures to measles after an adult tested positive after traveling internationally. There are 3 public spots that the County of Santa Clara Public Health Department and Alameda County Public Health Department officials are highlighting as possible exposures to the highly contagious disease.

""The person tested positive after returning from international travel, including passing through a U.S. airport where the person might have been exposed to measles,"" both agencies said in a news release. ""The person was not hospitalized and is now isolating at home.""

Date / Location / Time of potential exposures
---------------------------------------------
- 21 May 2025 / H Mart: 1710 Oakland Rd., San Jose, CA 95131 / 7:15 p.m. to 9 p.m.
- 23 May 2025 / Starbucks: 35040 Newark Blvd., Newark, CA 94560 / 11:45 a.m. to 2 p.m.
- 25 May 2025 / Trader Joe's: 1306 Great Mall Pkwy., Milpitas, CA 95035 / 4:45 p.m. to 8 p.m.

University of California, San Francisco Infectious Disease Speciality Dr. Peter Chin Hong said those who are vaccinated against the disease or have had it in the past don't have to worry.

The bad news is that it's one of the most transmissible infectious agents we know, so that somebody can have measles, be at Trader Joe's, leave, and then 2 hours later, somebody who is walking into Trader Joe's can get it,"" he said.

Those who have been vaccinated against the disease should have received 2 shots.

""There are some people who may have only gotten one shot, but even one shot gives you about 93% protection, and we think that lasts for many years, if not lifelong,"" Chin Hong said. ""If you had measles, which is most of Americans before 1957, that is lifelong immunity.""

On Wednesday [28 May 2025], in Sacramento, the measles virus was detected in the wastewater. ""Most people don't have much to panic about. It's really the people who are not vaccinated or the people whose kids are not vaccinated that gives me a lot of worry,"" Chin Hong said.

Chin Hong said if someone is exposed and isn't vaccinated, they should isolate for about 3 weeks because it can take up to 3 weeks before someone can begin to show symptoms.

According to the Santa Clara and Alameda county public health departments, the last reported case of measles in Santa Clara County was in 2019.

""The Bay Area benefits from high rates of vaccination against measles,"" both agencies said.

""Most people in the area received 2 doses of measles vaccine (""MMR vaccine"") as children and are at low risk of getting measles if exposed. Two doses of MMR vaccine is the best protection against measles.""

[4] Colorado: multiple cases tied to a single international flight

Officials sound alarm after 3 travelers from same international flight contract measles at Denver airport
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colorado officials are sounding the alarm after a toddler and 2 others who touched down on a flight at Denver International Airport earlier in May 2025 contracted measles.

A vaccinated adult who was onboard Turkish Airlines flight 201, which landed in Denver on 13 May 2025, was the most recent person to test positive for the infectious disease, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced Thursday [29 May 2025].

Two other cases in the state have also been linked to the same flight, including an out-of-state traveler and an unvaccinated child under 5.

""Local public health agencies are contacting passengers and crew on the flight who were seated or working close to the person with measles and all lap children on the plane,"" officials said in relation to the latest detection.

Health authorities have been on high alert ever since the 1st passenger -- the out-of-state traveler -- tested positive last week. The passenger was in the international terminal before staying overnight at the nearby Quality Inn and Suites Denver International Airport, officials said. The infectious person then returned to the airport on 14 May 2025 and boarded a domestic flight.

The child, who was described as a ""toddler,"" was confirmed to have the disease late last week after recently traveling with relatives to ""multiple international locations with increased measles cases,"" according to officials.

""The child was unvaccinated and remains hospitalized. The patient is placed in appropriate isolation so there's no ongoing exposure risk to other patients and families at the hospital,"" the health department said last Friday [24 May 2025].

""This situation underscores the critical importance of vaccination. Staying up to date on vaccinations and being aware of health risks when traveling are important ways to protect yourself and your community,"" Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist and deputy chief medical officer at the state's health department said.

""Measles is highly contagious, and we are working swiftly to identify and notify anyone who may have been exposed. Vaccination remains the most effective protection against this preventable disease.""

<https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14748427/Whooping-cough-Queensland.html>


Whooping cough cases explode in Queensland
------------------------------------------
A concerning surge of pertussis (whooping cough) is gripping Queensland after the state recorded thousands of cases in the first months of 2025. Queensland Health data revealed there have already been 2384 cases of whooping cough which is nearly three-and-a-half times the 2020-24 average. There were 15 012 pertussis infections in Queensland in 2024, which was more than what was recorded in the previous 11 years combined.

Doctors have put the worrying figures down to a lack of immunization since the COVID-19 pandemic and poor personal hygiene. The disease is particularly dangerous for young children with one child dying from the infection in 2024. Mater Hospital Brisbane director of infectious diseases Professor Paul Griffin said infection rates during the past 12 months were very worrying. 'It is important people appreciate that the numbers are very high and higher than we'd normally see,' he said. Then if we add to that, a reduction in vaccination rates, that's certainly going to be a factor, and going to be contributing to the significance of those cases as well. We know it's far worse in people who aren't vaccinated.'

In 2024, 90.8% of one-year-olds were vaccinated against the disease, which was down from 94.4% at the end of 2018, according to Queensland Health. Vaccination rates among pregnant women have also dropped, from around 77% in 2020 to around 70% in 2023. Whooping cough can lead to complications like pneumonia, brain damage, and even death. 

University of South Australia biostatistics and epidemiology Professor Adrian Esterman said whooping cough outbreaks generally occurred every 3 to 5 years in Australia. He said the outbreak, which was initially expected around 2020-22, had been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Professor Esterman called for authorities to promote vaccination while acting chief health officer Catherine McDougall said vaccination against the contagious respiratory infection was essential for babies and young kids. 'Vaccines save lives and we know that vaccinating pregnant women against whooping cough reduces the risk of their babies contracting the infection by 75%,' she said.

'That's why it's especially crucial for pregnant women to be vaccinated to protect themselves and their unborn babies. While the number of cases per week has declined since then to between 50-80 cases per week over the last 4 weeks, it's clear that whooping cough is continuing to circulate in the Queensland community, which is why it's critical that people get vaccinated to protect themselves and their loved ones.'

The whooping cough vaccine is free under the National Immunisation Program during pregnancy and for children aged 2, 4, 6 and 18 months, as well as youths aged between 12 and 19. Boosters are recommended 10 years after vaccinations.

Two more Colorado measles infections connected to out-of-state traveler
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said 2 more cases of measles have been confirmed in connection with an out-of-state traveler who went through Denver International Airport in May 2025. Officials said the latest cases are 2 unvaccinated adults who reside in El Paso County. Officials said the adults are not related to each other, but were both at the airport around the same time on 14 May 2025.

There have now been 5 confirmed cases of measles associated with the out-of-state traveler, who arrived in Denver on 13 May 2025 on Turkish Airlines flight 201. Those include that traveler, 2 Colorado residents on that flight, and now 2 El Paso County residents who were at the airport during the exposure period. 

Authorities said the 2 from El Paso County were at these locations while infectious, and anyone who was there during the following dates and times may have been exposed:

Location / Address / Date-Time / When symptoms may develop
- Love's Travel Stop / Carl's Jr. / 748 22 Road Grand Junction, CO / Tuesday, 27 May 2025, 6 - 10 p.m. / Through 17 Jun 2025
- Maverick Gas Station / 2588 Airport Rd. Colorado Springs, CO / Wednesday, 28 May 2025, 9 - 11:30 a.m. / Through 18 Jun 2025
- King Soopers / 1750 W. Uintah St. Colorado Springs, CO / Saturday, 31 May 2025 8:30 a.m. - 12:45 p.m. / Through 21 Jun 2025

CDPHE advised anyone who was at these locations to monitor for symptoms, which usually develop between 7 to 21 days after exposure. Anyone showing symptoms is encouraged to immediately contact their health care provider or call an urgent care center or emergency department. They said to be sure to call ahead so that the medical professionals can prevent additional exposures.

To date, there have been 9 confirmed measles cases in the state. According to CDPHE, measles is rare in Colorado. There were zero cases in the state in 2024.

Second UP measles case confirmed in Ontonagon County
---------------------------------------------------
The Western Upper Peninsula Health Department confirmed a second measles case in the UP on Friday [30 May 2025]. The WUPHD says this person is from Marquette County and was visiting family in Ontonagon County. The WUPHD confirmed that this individual is different from the confirmed case in Marquette County on Thursday [29 May 2025]; it is unknown if the 2 cases are related.

The WUPHD says it is working closely with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Marquette County Health Department to investigate the situation and prevent additional cases. The individual is following all isolation protocols.

Individuals who visited the following locations may have been exposed to measles:
- UP Health Systems - Portage, Express Care - 921 W. Sharon Ave., Houghton, MI, 49931 Mon 26 May from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. (ET)
- Aspirus Ironwood Emergency Department - N10561 Grandview Lane, Ironwood, MI, 49938 Tue 27 May from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. (CT)

Additional sites of potential exposure may be identified as more information becomes available.

The measles vaccine is a highly effective, very safe and provides long-lasting protection. In general, individuals with 2 appropriately spaced doses of MMR are considered immune. With the risk of community spread, anyone not fully vaccinated against measles is encouraged to do so as soon as possible. Contact your health care provider if you have questions regarding the status of immunity to measles or WUPHD at 906-482-7382 for assistance in locating vaccination records. The MMR vaccine is available through some health care providers; Western Upper Peninsula Health Department offices in Hancock, Bessemer, L'Anse, and Ontonagon; and many pharmacies.

Measles in Central Texas: 6 cases detected in Williamson County
--------------------------------------------
On 22 May [2025], WCCHD [Williamson County and Cities Health District] confirmed the county's first case: a child from Leander who attended Bar W Elementary in Liberty Hill ISD. Earlier this week, WCCHD announced a second confirmed measles case in Leander. The unvaccinated adult is no longer believed to be infectious. The resident was also not present in Williamson County while they were contagious.

According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, the 6 Williamson County cases are not believed to be connected to the measles outbreak in West Texas. Information about the other four cases was not immediately available.

Williamson County did not comment on the state's new cases, but WCCHD's Dr. Amanda Norwood did speak last week about why even one case is a concern.

""What we know about measles is that it is a highly infectious disease,"" said Norwood. ""We do know that it can linger in the air for up to 2 hours even after the infected person leaves the space."" That's why she points back to the basics: monitor any cold and flu-like symptoms and get the vaccine.

""Make sure that you are preventing against measles, staying vigilant, making sure that we're paying attention to signs and symptoms, then even as an individual, making those choices for you, you are having a positive impact on the community,"" said Norwood.

The state says they don't believe there's any concern for future exposure to the virus, at least regarding the new cases, but Liberty Hill ISD is asking families to monitor their health until mid-June [2025] for potential exposure.

Mumps Cases and Outbreaks
-------------------------
Key Points
----------
- Mumps cases in the United States decreased significantly after the mumps vaccine program began in 1967, but they have increased since 2006.
- Most recent outbreaks have occurred in settings with intense or frequent close contact, such as college campuses or close-knit communities.
- These outbreaks and their circulation across the country highlight the importance of high vaccination coverage to limit mumps outbreaks.

After the mumps vaccination program started in 1967, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. However, mumps outbreaks still occur, particularly in settings where people have close, prolonged contact, such as universities, schools, and correctional facilities.

During these outbreaks, people who previously had 1 or 2 doses of MMR vaccine can still get mumps. Experts aren't sure why vaccinated people still get mumps, but some evidence suggests that:
- Some people's immune systems may not respond as well as they should to the vaccine.
- The mumps vaccine may produce antibodies (proteins created by the body's immune system to help fight infections) that are not as effective against wild-type virus strains.
- In some people, antibodies from mumps vaccination may decrease overtime, until they no longer protect the person from mumps.
- As most people are not routinely exposed to mumps, there is less immunologic boosting (where people are exposed to mumps which boosts their immunity, but they do not get sick).

Disease symptoms are milder and complications are less frequent in vaccinated people. High vaccination coverage also helps to limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks. So, it's still very important to be up to date on MMR vaccine.

During a mumps outbreak, public health authorities might recommend an additional dose of MMR vaccine for people who belong to groups at increased risk for getting mumps. These groups are usually those who are likely to have close contact, such as sharing sport equipment or drinks, kissing, or living in close quarters, with a person who has mumps.

Your local public health authorities or institution will notify you if you are at increased risk and should receive this additional dose. If you already have 2 doses of MMR, it is not necessary to seek out vaccination unless the authorities tell you that you are part of this group.

First measles case of the year in South Dakota as CDC updates travel guidance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
South Dakota has reported its first case of measles in 2025. The state is now the 33rd in the country to confirm a measles case, with at least 1088 cases reported nationally so far in 2025. An adult who recently traveled outside the country tested positive for measles in Meade County, South Dakota, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.

It comes as federal officials are urging all Americans to get vaccinated against measles before traveling abroad, according to guidance updated last week from the CDC. Previously, the guidance stated that those traveling to countries with an ongoing outbreak should be vaccinated before leaving. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is part of the routine immunization schedule and has been shown to be up to 97% effective after 2 doses, the CDC says. Adults without immunity through vaccination or infection should also get vaccinated, the agency notes.

At least 62 people in the United States were infected with measles while traveling on an airplane this year [2025], a CDC spokesperson told ABC News in part of a statement. ""There has been only one situation during this period in which measles appeared to have been transmitted during air travel,"" the spokesperson added.

In South Dakota, the person infected with measles visited 2 medical centers where others may have been exposed to the virus. The Department of Health says anyone who was at the Rapid City Medical Center Urgent Care waiting room on May 28 between 7:15 a.m. and 10 a.m., or at Monument Health Sturgis Urgent Care waiting room on May 29 between 9:45 a.m. and 3 p.m., should watch for signs of illness

Minnesota confirms 2 new measles cases, including exposure at Mall of America
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) has confirmed 2 new cases of measles, including a case involving community exposure at the Mall of America. MDH investigators say a child was infectious while visiting the indoor theme park at the Mall of America on May 24 [2025]. People who were at the mall between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. that day may have been exposed to the virus and should monitor for symptoms from May 31 through June 14, according to the MDH news release.

Health officials continue to emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated for measles, which is the best defense against the virus. Children should receive 2 doses: the first between 12 and 15 months of age and the second between ages 4 and 6. Infants as young as 6 months can receive the vaccine early if travel puts them at higher risk. The CDC says the measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after exposure for those who have received 2 doses, and 93% effective for those who have received a single dose.

""Measles spreads easily, and it finds those who are vulnerable,"" Jessica Hancock-Allen, director of the infectious disease division at MDH, said in the release. ""We are seeing increased measles cases throughout the United States and internationally this year [2025]. The time is now for families to make sure their children are up to date on their immunizations to protect them from this potentially serious disease.""

Measles is a highly contagious illness that spreads through coughing, sneezing, or simply being in the same room as someone infected. The virus can linger in the air for up to 2 hours. Initial symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes, followed by a rash that usually starts on the head and spreads to the body. Symptoms typically appear 8 to 12 days after exposure, with the rash developing 2 to 3 days after the onset of fever. People who develop symptoms are advised to call their healthcare provider before visiting a clinic to avoid exposing others. Most people born before 1957 are considered immune due to past infection.

Health officials said the other unrelated case involved an adult from Washington County with an unverified vaccination status who was exposed during domestic air travel outside Minnesota.

Ecuador records 1366 cases of whooping cough
--------------------------------------------
The Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health confirmed that whooping cough infections in Ecuador reached 1366 people by the end of May 2025.

Deaths from this infectious disease also rose to 23.

Whooping cough in Ecuador primarily affects children under 5 years of age, with infants being the most vulnerable.

According to the latest official data, 587 of the cases were in children under one year old and 226 in children between 1 and 4 years old.

ManabÃ­, Guayas, Pichincha and Azuay concentrate the infections
--------------------------------------------------------------
The provinces most affected by the spread of this bacterial respiratory disease are ManabÃ­ (309 cases), Guayas (258), Pichincha (220) and Azuay (138).

These territories have seen an exponential increase since the beginning of 2025, when only 321 cases were recorded nationwide.

The Ecuadorian government has implemented preventive measures since May 2025, including an intensification of the vaccination campaign and mandatory use of masks in schools and colleges in the most critical areas.

Whooping cough vaccination is being intensified across the country
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health launched a national vaccination campaign to contain the spread of the outbreak. This action is part of the epidemiological control protocol established by the National Emergency Management Agency (COE).

In parallel, authorities have worked to raise public awareness about the importance of vaccinating children under 5, especially in rural areas where access to medical services may be limited.

Chimborazo declares alert and adjusts educational measures
----------------------------------------------------------
In Chimborazo, the Emergency Operations Committee (COE) declared itself on alert last week following a worrying spike in cases.

In-person classes were initially suspended for 2 months. However, after a further evaluation, it was decided to resume in-person classes starting this Monday, 2 Jun 2025.

Mandatory mask-wearing will be enforced during mass events, and if new infections occur in schools, students through 3rd grade will receive virtual classes for a period of 10 days.

The peak of infections was recorded at the beginning of May [2025]
------------------------------------------------------------------
According to data from the Ministry of Health, the peak of whooping cough in Ecuador occurred in early May [2025], with 278 new cases in a single week.

Since then, a slight slowdown in the infection rate has been observed, attributed to the new health measures implemented.

Case monitoring remains active throughout the country, with special attention to the coastal and north-central Sierra provinces, where the majority of deaths have been recorded, 16 of them in infants under one year of age.

Whopping Cough Outbreak Near San Jose, Costa Rica
-------------------------------------------------
Since April 2024, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of the Republic of Costa Rica has reported an outbreak of _Bordetella pertussis_ (whooping cough) in the Tibas district of San Jose, which has a population of over 70 000 residents.

As of 2 Jun 2025, the MOH remains on alert for whooping cough cases in local schools, which are primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing, and have an incubation period ranging from 4 to 21 days.

On 20 May 2025, a case of whooping cough was confirmed in a teacher at a school in Golfito and a resident of the Corredores canton. There are now 14 confirmed cases in home isolation, in good general health, and receiving treatment and monitoring from the inter-institutional team.

Following the initial diagnosis, 79 direct contacts were identified, including 72 students, 6 teachers, and 1 cleaning staff member. Of these, 31 people presented symptoms.

The MOH recommends that the local population comply with the national vaccination schedule: the Pentavalent vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 15 months, the Tetravalent vaccine at 4 years old, and the vaccine for pregnant women, indicated from the 20th week of pregnancy.

About 18 years ago, Costa Rico declared a whooping cough emergency and launched a nationwide vaccination program.

While the U.S. CDC advises individuals planning to visit Costa Rica in June 2025 to stay up to date with routine vaccinations, the agency also highlights the presence of Chikungunya and measles in Costa Rica.

These travel vaccines are commercially offered at clinics and pharmacies in the U.S. and should be administered about one month before departure abroad.

<https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/06/03/measles-in-europe-where-are-cases-of-one-of-the-most-contagious-diseases-rising>


One of the world's most contagious diseases is spreading in Europe. Measles has been on the rise for months. Last year [2024] was the worst for measles in Europe and Central Asia since 1997, with more than 120 000 cases reported across the region. Health authorities have warned that cases are likely to rise in the coming months.

So far in 2025, about 5500 measles cases have been reported across the European Union (EU), according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Over the past year, many cases have been among unvaccinated children under the age of 5, the agency says.

Measles is usually a mild or moderately severe illness, but in some cases it can lead to deadly complications. It's extremely contagious, but vaccination is effective at keeping people from getting sick.

Here's where cases are highest in 2025, according to ECDC data through the end of April [2025].

Measles in Romania
------------------
The vast majority of the EU's measles cases are in Romania, which has reported 3605 infections as of late April 2025. Three people have died.

The country's years-long outbreak has been driven by anti-vaccine sentiment, conflicting health guidance, and a medical system struggling to keep up. In 2023, just 62% of the population was fully vaccinated against measles, far below the 95% threshold needed to prevent outbreaks.

Measles in France
-----------------
There have been 526 measles cases so far in 2025 in France, spurred in part by a ""notable increase"" in the number of measles cases brought into the country this year, the ECDC said. At least 41 infections have been linked to someone who brought the virus in from Morocco, compared to 26 cases in 2024.

In 2023, 93% of people in France were fully vaccinated. But if there are pockets of unvaccinated people in a community, measles can easily take hold.

Measles in the Netherlands
--------------------------
The Netherlands reported 371 measles infections in the first 4 months of 2025. More than 24 cases were among people who contracted measles in Morocco or Romania and then came into the Netherlands.

Dutch health authorities said there are ""clusters"" of measles infections, for example, at primary schools or childcare facilities, with most cases among children under the age of 10. But they stressed there is no national measles outbreak.

At 81%, the Netherlands has one of the lowest measles vaccination rates in the EU. Only Romania and Cyprus (80%) had lower coverage levels.

Measles in Italy
----------------
In Italy, 268 measles infections have been recorded so far in 2025. Overall, in the year ending in late January 2025, it has had more cases than anywhere in the EU except Romania. The country's measles vaccination rate was 85% in 2023, too low to stave off outbreaks.

Measles in Spain
----------------
Spain is experiencing outbreaks in several parts of the country, resulting in 251 measles infections this year [2025]. Several cases were also imported from outside of Spain, the ECDC said.

Notably, 92% of people in Spain were fully vaccinated against measles in 2023, landing the country near herd immunity. In May 2025, the Spanish Ministry of Health encouraged people to check their vaccination status amid the uptick in measles cases both worldwide and within Spain. ""The resumption of mobility after the pandemic has increased the risk of imported cases,"" the ministry said.

An outbreak of diphtheria has been confirmed in Edo State, resulting in 2 fatalities.

The State Commissioner for Health, Cyril Oshiomhole, made this known on Tuesday [3 Jun 2025] in Benin during an emergency response meeting.

The action follows confirmation from the University of Benin Teaching Hospital of 5 diphtheria cases, including the 2 deaths.

The emergency meeting included representatives from WHO, UNICEF, local health bodies, and key partners tackling the unfolding public health threat.

Mr Oshiomhole described the outbreak as ""a serious cause for concern,"" warning of the infection's potential severity if not treated quickly.

He noted that diphtheria, a contagious bacterial infection affecting the nose and throat, could cause severe complications or death.

""The increase in cases, combined with rising threats like drug resistance and viral infections, demands urgent, coordinated efforts,"" he said.

He outlined key strategies, including deploying a rapid response team, improving coordination, and boosting surveillance and contact tracing.

Other priorities include raising public awareness, engaging communities, and ensuring vaccine availability and access.

The commissioner praised UBTH for its swift response and acknowledged ongoing support from health partners. He assured the public of the state government's commitment to containing the outbreak.

Citizens are advised to report symptoms early -- such as sore throat, fever, or breathing difficulty -- and to avoid close contact with sick individuals.

He also urged people to stay calm but alert. ""This is not a time to panic, but to prepare, inform, and act responsibly,"" he added.

Pakistan is witnessing a concerning rise in polio cases as the highly contagious virus has been detected for the 1st time in Gilgit-Baltistan.

According to health officials, the region's 1st confirmed case has emerged from the Diamer district, where a 23-month-old child has tested positive for the poliovirus.

The National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad has officially confirmed the presence of the virus in the child.

With this latest case, the total number of polio cases reported in Pakistan in 2025 has risen to 11.

Health authorities have expressed serious concern over the expanding reach of the virus, particularly to areas like Gilgit-Baltistan that were previously considered polio-free.

Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a highly infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. It primarily affects children under the age of 5 and can lead to permanent paralysis or even death in severe cases. The virus spreads through contaminated food and water or direct contact with an infected person. There is no cure for polio, but it can be prevented through multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV), which builds immunity in children.

Pakistan remains one of the few countries in the world where polio is still endemic. Despite repeated vaccination campaigns, challenges such as misinformation, vaccine refusal, and limited access in remote areas continue to hinder eradication efforts.

Health officials urge parents to ensure their children are vaccinated and to cooperate with polio teams during national immunization drives to help protect every child from this life-threatening disease.

First case of measles confirmed in Bell County, Texas
-----------------------------------------------------
The Bell County Public Health District (BCPH) on 3 Jun 2025 announced its 1st confirmed case of measles in an unvaccinated adult. County health officials are investigating the case for any potential community exposures, including identifying the status of recent international or domestic travel.

Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that can cause life-threatening illness or death, especially in babies and children, health officials said. It is easily spread through the air or close contact. Measles is a vaccine preventable disease with a 97% effectiveness rate when fully vaccinated.

Measles spreads through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, or talks. A person can become infected by breathing contaminated air or touching contaminated surfaces then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth. People with measles are contagious about 4 days before their rash starts to 4 days after it appears. The virus can stay in the air and on surfaces for up to 2 hours after the infected person has left the area.

Measles can cause serious illness in all age groups. However, certain groups are more likely to suffer complications such as pneumonia or brain swelling from measles. The groups of people at highest risk for measles complications include: all individuals who are not vaccinated or have not previously had a measles infection; children younger than 5 years old; pregnant women; and people with weakened immune systems, from leukemia, HIV infection, etc.

""We urge the public to remain vigilant about signs and symptoms of measles, especially if you are unvaccinated or at high risk,"" stated Amy J. Yeager, District Director, Bell County Public Health. ""We encourage you to know your vaccination status and to get the MMR vaccine to help protect you and others in the community.""

<https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/passenger-with-measles-traveled-in-out-of-salt-lake-city-intl-airport#google_vignette>


Passenger with measles traveled in, out of Salt Lake City Int'l Airport
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A passenger with an active case of measles traveled through Salt Lake City International Airport multiple times before Memorial Day. Utah health officials did not believe the incident warranted an alert or advisory at the time and shared why they made that call. The passenger's travel in Utah was first reported by the Park Record. Both dates of travel in and out of the airport occurred just days before the Memorial Day holiday weekend, which was first brought to light in a meeting of the Summit County Board of Health.

The passenger traveled to Salt Lake City from Canada on 19 May 2025 before driving a rental vehicle to Burley, Idaho for a business trip. Four days later, the person then traveled from Idaho back to Salt Lake City, where they boarded another flight from the airport. During their time in the area, the passenger was not believed to have made any stops in Utah after arriving and before departing from the airport. The Utah Department of Health and Human Services says other passengers on the individual's flights were contacted by the Salt Lake County Health Department, ""and connected to appropriate service to prevent infection.""

""Happily, this person did have some protection already, and before they got this measles case, they knew they had been exposed back in their home country, but had thought they were protected, so traveled,"" explained Utah State epidemiologist Leisha Nolen. ""And so the evidence suggests when they do have that kind of vaccine protection, they are less infectious, they have a milder infection, and so therefore it is quite likely that they didn't have a very infectious case, and therefore there wouldn't be people who would get it from them.""

The Summit County Board of Health, and presumably other state health agencies, were first notified that the unidentified individual had flown into Salt Lake City while they were in Idaho. Members of the board expressed surprise upon learning the passenger received some sort of medical attention for measles while in Idaho and was still allowed to travel back to Utah to board another flight in Salt Lake City.

While the Summit County Board of Health claimed the passenger has been placed on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ""Do Not Board"" list, which bans them from flying anywhere in the United States, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services disputed that, saying they were ""past their infectious period by the time of their departing flight.""

State health officials chose not to issue a health advisory or warning, as it was determined to be ""low-risk"" and there was no need to create ""chaos,"" Summit County Nursing Director Derek Moss said during the meeting.

""Certainly, it is always a question of when do we want to tell the public about something,"" said Nolen. ""Certainly, we want the public to be aware of things that are a threat to them and that they can do something to protect themselves about. So we really try to prioritize those messages where it is something that we want people to go and change behaviors, where they can do something to protect themselves, when they can watch for symptoms.

[Editado por Jaime Torres]


El estado de Colorado ha confirmado 10 casos de sarampión este año, después de que tres personas más se enfermaron en el brote vinculado al aeropuerto internacional de Denver (DVI por sus siglas en inglés).

Dos de los nuevos casos fueron adultos no vacunados que vivían en el condado de El Paso que pasaron por el aeropuerto aproximadamente al mismo tiempo el 14 de mayo. El tercero era un residente vacunado del condado de Arapahoe que era un pasajero en el vuelo 201 de Turkish Airlines, que aterrizó en DIA el 13 de mayo y transportaba a un pasajero contagioso.

Dos dosis de la vacuna son aproximadamente 97% efectivas, lo que significa que un pequeño número de personas desarrollan casos innovadores.

Los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades declaran un brote si un estado tiene al menos tres casos vinculados. El vuelo de Turkish Airlines cumple con la definición de un brote, pero el departamento de salud del estado no ha visto ninguna evidencia de propagación en toda la comunidad, dijo la portavoz Hope Shuler.

El residente del condado de Arapahoe no salió durante su período contagioso, por lo que no pudieron pasar el virus. Los residentes del condado de El Paso visitaron tres ubicaciones entre ellos, y los funcionarios de salud pública aconsejaron a las personas que estén atentos a los síntomas si iban a los siguientes lugares:

Love’s Travel Stop y Carls Jr., 748 22 Road, Grand Junction, de 6 a 10 p.m. 27 de mayo. Los síntomas podrían desarrollarse hasta el 17 de junio. Maverick Gass Station, 2588 Airport Road, Colorado Springs, de 9 a 11:30 a.m., 28 de mayo. Los síntomas podrían desarrollarse hasta el 18 de junio. King Sopers, 1750 W. Uintah St., Colorado Springs, de 8:30 AM a 12:45 mayo de 31.

Las personas no vacunadas a veces pueden prevenir la infección al recibir el sarampión dentro de las 72 horas de exposición. Esa ventana ha pasado para las personas expuestas en la parada de camiones y la estación de servicio, pero los expuestos en King Soopers todavía tienen la opción.

Otros casos entre los residentes de Colorado incluyen otro adulto del condado de Arapahoe y un niño del condado de Arapahoe menor de 5 años, quienes llegaron al vuelo de Turkish Airlines; un adulto de Pueblo; un bebé de Denver y una persona no identificada que vive en la misma casa; un adulto de Denver; y un adulto del condado de Archuleta.

El niño necesitaba atención en Children’s Hospital Colorado, que no ha publicado información sobre su condición. Todos los pacientes adultos se recuperaron en casa.

En un año típico, Colorado tiene dos casos o menos de sarampión. La última vez que el estado registró más de 10 en un año fue en la década de 1990.

ND Public Health Association finds state has highest rate of measles per capita in USA
----------------------------------------------------------
As the measles continue to spread among unvaccinated individuals in parts of the state, more people have become affected by the virus, either because they contracted it or have been to an exposure site. The state of North Dakota now has 34 reported cases of the disease, all of whom are unvaccinated.

The North Dakota Public Health Association (NDPHA) reported that as of the end of May [2025], the Peace Garden State has the highest rate of infection per 100 000 among all states, even beating out Texas, where hundreds of people contracted the virus.

State / 2024 est. population / Measles cases 30 May 2025 / Cases per 100 000
---------------------------------------------
North Dakota / 796 568 / 34 / 4.27
New Mexico / 2 130 156 / 79 / 3.71
Texas / 31 290 831 / 770 / 2.46
Kansas / 2 970 606 / 64 / 2.15
Montana / 1 137 233 / 13 / 1.14

The NDPHA posted on their social media what they believe is the reason for the spike in cases in the state.

""This is not a result of a local public health failure,"" the post says. ""This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated, and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.""

According to the CDC, 91% of kindergarteners in North Dakota were vaccinated entering the 2023-24 school year. That's down from 94.8% in 2019-20.

Measles case reported in Putnam County, NY. Here's the warning from health officials.
-----------------------------------------------------------
A measles case has been confirmed in Putnam County, New York, and health officials have a warning for anyone who visited a local tavern while the person was there last month [May 2025].

The Putnam County Department of Health announced the case Wednesday [4 Jun 2025], saying the infected person contracted the measles while traveling abroad. The department said the person is no longer contagious, but officials are working to locate anyone who may have come in contact with the person while they were.

The department believes the person only went to one local establishment during that period. Officials say anyone who visited Arturo's Tavern at 878 Route 6 in Mahopac, between 6 and 10 p.m. on Wed 28 May, should call 845-808-1390 to speak with a nurse.

""The owner and staff at Arturo's Tavern have assisted in every way possible to help identify any additional exposures. They share our priority -- to ensure the health and safety of our Putnam residents and guests,"" Putnam County Health Director Rian Rodriguez said in a statement.

Earlier this spring, New Jersey health officials warned of cases at an NJ Turnpike service area, Newark Liberty International Airport and at the Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium. Cases have also been confirmed this year in New York City and on Long Island.

Pawnee County measles cases deemed outbreak
-------------------------------------------
With 7 measles cases now on record in Pawnee County, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment on Monday [2 Jun 2025] added the current total to its outbreak status. Its latest dashboard posting noted that last week, 7 more cases were added to the state's list, bringing the total to 71 since the beginning of 2025. Measles was first reported in a Pawnee County resident by the Pawnee County Health Department to KDHE the last week of May [2025].

KDHE has also linked the Pawnee County cases to the outbreak affecting 9 counties in southwest Kansas. Previous cases reported in Reno and Sedgwick counties are not connected.

KDHE reported that of the total outbreak cases, 58 patients have never been vaccinated, with only 5 patients up to date on their vaccines.

While the highly contagious disease can cause serious health complications, especially in children under the age of 5, so far 3 cases have required hospitalization, with no deaths connected to the outbreak.

 South Korea reports 52 measles cases, highest tally in 6 years
 
 ---------------------------------------
 
 South Korea has confirmed 52 measles cases in 2025, marking the highest number in 6 years, as global outbreaks of once-eliminated infectious diseases resurge. According to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), the confirmed cases surpass 2024's total of 49 and are the highest since 2019, when 194 cases were reported. South Korea was declared measles-free by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2014.
 
 
 
 However, the recent rise is attributed to factors such as increased international travel and an aging population. Of the 52 cases, 34 were imported, largely from countries like Viet Nam, while 18 were locally transmitted through contact with international travelers in households and medical facilities. Despite the surge, health officials emphasize that the risk of rapid outbreaks remains low due to South Korea's stable vaccination rates and robust monitoring system.
 
 
 
 The spike in measles cases follows a period of minimal infections during the COVID-19 pandemic, with just 6 cases in 2020 and none in 2021 or 2022. In 2023, there were 8 cases. Health authorities are closely monitoring the situation and continue to emphasize the importance of vaccinations to maintain herd immunity.

Measles-infected baby dies in southwestern Ontario
--------------------------------------------------
Ontario's Ministry of Health has announced the 1st recorded death of a measles patient from the current outbreak that started in October 2024. Dr. Kieran Moore, chief medical officer of health, issued a statement Thursday [5 Jun 2025] saying a southwestern Ontario infant has died after being born prematurely and infected with the highly contagious virus through the mother.

""The child contracted the virus before birth from the mother, who had not been immunized against measles, mumps and rubella,"" Moore said in an interview with CBC News. ""Measles was a significant contributing factor in the premature death of this child, but the child also had other serious medical complications unrelated to the virus.""

Southwestern Public Health, which covers Oxford and Elgin counties, confirmed the child was from a community in their coverage area. ""Out of respect for the family's privacy, no further personal or medical details will be shared,"" Moore said.

The death is the 1st in this current outbreak, which at last count, on Tuesday [3 Jun 2025], included up to 2009 probable and confirmed cases since it began on 28 Oct 2025, according to the ministry. The death announced is only the 2nd measles-related death Ontario has seen in decades, after an unvaccinated child from Hamilton who was younger than 5 years old died in May 2024.

Hepatitis cases surge in district, health dept issues monsoon warning
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A concerning rise in hepatitis cases has gripped the district [Thrissur], with 57 infections reported in May 2025 alone. Alarm bells rang louder on 28 May 2025, when 7 new cases were confirmed in a single day. With the onset of the monsoon, health officials have issued a stern warning to the public to remain alert against the spread of infectious diseases. District Medical Officer (DMO) T P Sreedevi urged the public to take precautions seriously. ""Only boiled and properly treated water should be used for drinking. Avoid stale food at all costs,"" she advised.

Hepatitis A and E, both of which affect the liver, are commonly spread through contaminated food and water. The DMO emphasized that hotels and eateries must boil water before serving and avoid mixing cold water with hot water. With monsoon conditions creating a breeding ground for waterborne diseases, health officials have asked people to stay alert for diarrhoea symptoms. Hepatitis infections may take 15 to 60 days to surface, with early signs including fever, fatigue, body aches, headache, nausea, and later, yellowing of the skin, eyes, and urine.

The Health Department has outlined several preventive steps:
• Drink only boiled or purified water
• Wash hands thoroughly with soap before eating and after using the toilet
• Avoid spoiled or uncovered food
• Trim nails and maintain personal hygiene
• Safely dispose of children's waste
• Store food and drinking water in covered containers
• Wash fruits and vegetables well
• Ensure chlorination of water at pumping stations and periodically chlorinate well water

DMO Sreedevi stressed that early intervention is crucial in containing the spread of infection. She urged the public to remain cautious during festivals and travel by prioritizing hygiene. Anyone experiencing diarrhea should avoid self-medication and consult health personnel immediately. The Health Department has already begun preventive efforts across the district as it braces for monsoon-linked health challenges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Departmental Health Service (Sedes) of Santa Cruz declared a health red alert for measles on Friday [6 Jun 2025] and activated all resources to contain the outbreak of the disease. ""Sedes, concerned about the measles situation, has determined to declare a health red alert in the department of Santa Cruz in the face of the confirmation of the third positive case of measles, the second in this last week,"" said the director of Sedes, Jaime Bilbao, at a press conference.

The health red alert will allow the mobilization of the human, logistical and communicational resources available to contain and prevent new infections. The patient presented symptoms since Monday [2 Jun 2025] and was treated by the health system on the next day. The third case was confirmed this Friday [6 Jun 2025], so the epidemiological blockade actions were immediately activated.

In addition, the investigation is being carried out to identify possible direct contacts, especially to determine if there is a relationship with the case reported last week, of a young woman who attended an international event held at Fexpocruz.

To date, 188 people are under epidemiological monitoring for having contact with the last 2 positive cases. In addition, 8 suspected cases that are not linked to those confirmed are under active surveillance.

The director of Sedes urged the population to go to health centers to verify and complete vaccination schedules, and families to be attentive to symptoms such as fever, rash or headache, and go immediately to the doctor.

Measles and rubella weekly monitoring report
--------------------------------------------
This report provides a weekly summary of measles and rubella cases in Canada. Data are updated every Monday. This report was last updated on 2 Jun 2025 with data up to and including epidemiological week 21 (May 18 to 24, 2025). Previous versions of this weekly report are also available.

Key points
----------
- In week 21 (18 to 24 May 2025), 244 new measles cases (233 confirmed, 11 probable) were reported.
- In 2025, 2755 measles cases (2429 confirmed, 326 probable) and 0 rubella cases have been reported in Canada.
- Individuals traveling outside of Canada are encouraged to consult the travel health notices for information on measles and rubella outbreaks occurring in other countries.

Current measles situation
-------------------------
- In 2025, a total of 2755 measles cases (2429 confirmed, 326 probable) have been reported by 9 jurisdictions (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan), as of 24 May 2025.
- In week 21 (18 to 24 May 2025), 244 new measles cases (233 confirmed, 11 probable) were reported by 5 jurisdictions (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan).

Historical measles cases
------------------------
Measles has been eliminated in Canada since 1998, and therefore endemic transmission no longer takes place in the country. However, cases continue to occur sporadically, usually due to importation from regions where measles is circulating. Some imported cases result in time-limited outbreaks. From 1998 to 2024, there were an average of 91 measles cases reported in Canada annually, with between 0 and 752 cases reported each year.

Confirmed cases of measles in England by month, age, region and upper-tier local authority: 2025
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Situational update
------------------
In 2024 there were 2911 laboratory confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded annually since 2012. This was initially driven by an outbreak in Birmingham but was soon overtaken by a large outbreak in London, with small clusters in other regions. Case counts followed a downward trajectory from mid-July 2024 with small, localized outbreaks continuing in some regions. Here we present the epidemiology for measles from 1 Jan 2025. Data for 2023 and 2024 and historical data is available.

Since 1 Jan 2025, there have been 420 laboratory confirmed measles cases reported in England, an increase of 100 cases since the last report on 8 May 2025 (Figures 1 and 2 [for figures/tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]).

Summary
-------
The number of laboratory confirmed measles cases by month of symptom onset in 2025 to date are:

January: 88
February: 68
March: 68
April: 109
May: 86
June: 1 (to date)

The UKHSA data dashboard provides tabular data on the total number of cases by week of onset in 2025. The majority (276 of 420, 66%) of these cases were in children aged 10 years and under, and 29% (121 of 420) were in young people and adults aged 15 years and over (Table 1). 39% (162 of 420) of these cases have been in London, 14% (58 of 420) in the South West, and 14% (57 of 420) in the East of England. 82 upper tier local authorities (UTLAs) have reported at least one confirmed case with symptom onset since 1 Jan 2025, with the highest numbers reported in Bristol (47 of 420, 11%), Leeds (29 of 420, 7%) and Newham (23 of 420, 5%) (Table 2a).

The vaccination status of all confirmed cases is published quarterly in the related health protection reports. No acute measles-related deaths have been reported so far in 2025. Information on historical measles-related deaths is available on the notifications and deaths webpage.

Recent activity
---------------
There have been 75 laboratory confirmed measles cases with symptom onset date in the 4 weeks since 5 May 2025. Data reporting lags have the greatest impact on the most recent 4 weeks and therefore the reported figures are likely to underestimate activity. London accounted for the highest proportion of these cases (47%, 35 of 75). 25% (19 of 75) of cases have been in the North West, and 11% (8 of 75) in the West Midlands. 32 UTLAs have reported at least one confirmed case with symptom onset since 5 May 2025, with the highest number of cases reported in Hackney (n=12) and Salford (n=11) (Table 2b).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
With global measles cases still increasing, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) has urged travelers to take precautions and get vaccinated, following a surge in domestic cases linked to travel to countries where the virus is prevalent.

Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that causes symptoms such as fever, cough, and a distinctive rash.

As of 9 Aug [2025], KDCA data showed 68 confirmed measles cases since the government began closely monitoring outbreaks in December 2024, an increase of more than 40% compared with the same period a year previously. Of the 68 cases, 49 (72%) were contracted abroad and diagnosed after travelers returned to South Korea. The majority were linked to trips to Viet Nam (42 cases), followed by 3 from South Africa and one each from Uzbekistan, Thailand, Italy, and Mongolia.

According to the WHO, Europe recorded its highest number of measles infections in 25 years in 2024, with cases continuing to rise in 2025.

Dr. Rosangel Fernández Ruiz, the general director of Health in the area, confirmed the presence of several cases, although she did not specify how many, and urged the population to intensify sanitary measures to curb the spread of this highly contagious disease.

This disease is transmitted through contaminated water or food or by direct contact with an infected person. The expert indicated that, in case of symptoms such as fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, or yellowing of the skin or eyes, immediate isolation should be pursued.

To avoid infections, it is recommended to wash your hands with soap and water, especially before eating and after using the restroom, and to chlorinate drinking water, even if it comes from sources deemed safe.

""Hepatitis A, while not usually fatal, can overwhelm healthcare services if not controlled in time. In Cárdenas, the alert includes door-to-door monitoring in critical areas and strengthening chlorination in public sources,"" the press added.

The increase in cases of hepatitis A in Cuba is directly related to the consumption of water contaminated with feces. The lack of access to safe drinking water and poor hygiene conditions have exacerbated this situation, reflecting the inefficiency of the Cuban government to ensure a proper sanitary environment for its population.

Cuban health authorities issued an alert due to the increase in cases of this disease in several regions of the country in January 2025. In Cárdenas, that month, 32 active cases and about 30 suspected cases had been confirmed, primarily in the ""Fructuoso Rodríguez"" neighborhood.

Francisco Durán García, national director of Epidemiology, indicated that the increase in hepatitis A was recorded, particularly in urban areas with high population density.

Measles in thr Freyung-Grafenau District: Health Department reports 6 cases of infection
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In connection with the measles case first reported last week, the situation in the Freyung-Grafenau district has evolved. The health department is currently reporting 6 confirmed cases of infection in the district and 12 additional cases in other countries, including Poland, Italy, the Czech Republic, and England.

The cases of infection are temporally related to an international festival that took place in Jandelsbrunn/Zielberg in early May 2025 and attracted around 400 participants from several countries. During follow-up, it was revealed that the infected individuals had participated in the event or had come into contact with it in their extended environment.

Among those affected is a school-age child attending secondary school in Freyung. After the case became known, the health department reacted immediately and checked the vaccination status of the contact persons at the school and in the immediate extracurricular environment. All students in the class have adequate vaccination protection -- with the exception of one unvaccinated child. This child will be absent from school for 3 weeks as a precautionary measure -- a measure whose practical impact is currently limited due to the upcoming Whitsun holidays.

The health department informed those affected about the necessary hygiene rules, informed contact persons about the risk of infection, offered so-called ""blocking vaccinations,"" and informed the public. A blocking vaccination is a vaccination against measles that can be administered to susceptible individuals within 72 hours of contact in order to prevent or at least mitigate the severity of measles.

Following the initial report, the health department received several concerned inquiries from the public -- including from parents of unvaccinated children who may have had contact with an infected person. In addition, doctors, medical practices, and hospitals were specifically informed and sensitized to the disease measles so that they could respond quickly to suspected cases.

Due to the international dimension, the current situation was forwarded to the relevant political bodies and health authorities -- including the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), which is responsible for coordination at the federal level. This sharing of information is a mandatory part of the reporting chain for notifiable infectious diseases such as measles.

Current developments clearly demonstrate how quickly measles can spread through international travel. Several countries, including the USA, now have travel warnings due to the increased risk of measles. In this context, the Health Department points out that the willingness to be vaccinated among the population has declined in recent years -- with possible consequences for the regional and supra-regional health situation.

Measles is not a harmless childhood disease. The disease is highly contagious and can cause serious complications. A complete vaccination program offers reliable protection -- both individually and for the general public. The Freyung-Grafenau Health Department therefore calls on all citizens to check their vaccination status and get vaccinated if necessary.

Alarm as whooping cough runs rampant in Bay of Plenty
-----------------------------------------------------
Doctors are alarmed by high rates of whooping cough (pertusssis) in Bay of Plenty and Lakes districts, with 1 in 10 patients ending up in hospital. Since the national pertussis epidemic was declared late in 2024, there have been more than 300 reported cases across the wider region, with more than 30 people hospitalized.

Rotorua Hospital paediatrician Dr Danny de Lore said children most at risk were those living in communities where the immunisation rates were low. ""The continued spread of whooping cough is deeply worrying, especially for pepi under one year old,"" Dr de Lore said. ""We're seeing preventable hospitalisations. We know immunisation is the most effective protection, particularly for young children and hapu mama.""

Pregnant women, babies and Maori whanau [extended family groups] are being ""disproportionately affected"", with multiple babies needing continued hospital care. Dr de Lore said the best protection for babies was for their mother to get vaccinated during pregnancy, and for them to get their childhood vaccinations on time from 6 weeks to ensure ongoing protection.

Kentucky marks 1st whooping cough deaths since 2018. What we know
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Two Kentucky infants have died of pertussis -- commonly known as whooping cough -- within the past 6 months, marking the 1st deaths from the illness since 2018.

According to a 6 Jun 2025 Cabinet for Health and Family Services news release, neither the mothers nor the babies had received the recommended vaccinations to prevent the illness.

Health officials announced in July 2024 that whooping cough cases had begun increasing in Kentucky to levels not seen in more than a decade. Roughly 540 cases of whooping cough reported in Kentucky in 2024, the highest number of cases in the commonwealth since 2012. Nearly 250 cases have been reported so far in Kentucky in 2025. Officials anticipate cases will continue to increase during the summer and fall, based on historic trends.

Health officials have strongly recommended both adults and children to stay current with their vaccinations as cases continue to rise around the country.

""Anyone can get whooping cough, but infants are at greatest risk for life-threatening illness,"" KDPH Commissioner Dr. Steven Stack said in a statement. ""Fortunately, when vaccinations are administered to pregnant women, it provides protection to both the mother and the baby."" 

What are the symptoms of whooping cough?
----------------------------------------
Whooping cough can start with a runny nose and congestion, according to the release. The cough can become more severe after 1 to 2 weeks, making the ""whooping"" sound and sometimes causing vomiting.

Babies younger than 1 year old are at greatest risk for developing severe complications from whooping cough, officials said. Young infants also may not show classic symptoms of the illness and may not even have a cough, instead just struggling to breathe or stop breathing entirely.

People with pre-existing health conditions that may be worsened by whooping cough are at high risk for developing a severe infection, officials said.

For more information on the proper timing of vaccinations, contact a doctor or reference the CHFS website.

Six infants born with congenital measles in Ontario from unvaccinated mothers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ontario's chief medical officer of health says 6 infants have been born with congenital measles since an outbreak began in the fall of 2024, adding they were infected in the womb through mothers who were not vaccinated. Dr. Kieran Moore says these infants recovered, but their infections could have been prevented if their mothers had been vaccinated and protected from contracting measles.

Congenital measles can result in severe complications, including inflammation of the brain and death. On Thursday [5 Jun 2025], Moore announced an infant born prematurely and infected with measles died in southwestern Ontario. He says the infant also faced other serious medical complications unrelated to the virus.

In an interview with The Canadian Press, Moore says 40 pregnant people have been infected with measles in Ontario, and only 2 were vaccinated. Moore suggests unvaccinated pregnant people isolate if they live in a community with active measles cases.

Health officials have reported more than 2000 cases in the province since the outbreak began in October 2024.

The measles mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is not recommended once a person is pregnant because it contains a live virus that could theoretically be transmitted to the fetus. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends unvaccinated pregnant people get one dose of intravenous immunoglobulin within 6 days if they are exposed to measles.

However, Moore said that message faces hurdles similar to those around vaccine hesitancy. ""Some people, if they don't want a vaccine, they may not want the immunoglobulin either. That may be a philosophical choice,"" Moore said Friday [6 Jun 2025].

In an editorial published Monday [9 Jun 2025] in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, Dr. Catherine Varner argues pregnant people are ""bearing the burden"" of Canada's measles outbreak. ""Pregnant people are often at higher risk than the general population in infectious disease outbreaks. As such, they cannot be an afterthought in preventive strategies and health-care systems' responses,"" Varner writes.

Moore said the vast majority of pregnant people in Ontario are fully vaccinated against measles. ""It's only a very small subgroup of people who have chosen not to get vaccinated who are having the complications,"" he said.

""I know some will concentrate on the glass being half-empty. You know, to have that level of protection in the face of the risks globally, I think is quite an accomplishment. I'd love to have 100%, but we have to work with these communities that have chosen not to be vaccinated, and that is a long and difficult conversation that I think all of our health-care workers are dedicated to having.""

[Editado por Jaime Torres]


Desde marzo pasado, el avance del sarampión en la Argentina genera preocupación, incluso luego de que, ante este escenario, el Gobierno planteara campañas de vacunación con el foco puesto en los bebés y chicos hasta 5 años. Como la situación se mantiene, y no todos los casos pudieron confirmarse, la Comisión para la Certificación de la Eliminación de la Circulación Endémica de Sarampión, Rubéola y Síndrome de Rubéola Congénita, comenzó a reunirse de manera semanal para analizar aquellos que fueron notificados y están aún pendientes de clasificación: según los datos compartidos por el Ministerio de Salud de la Nación, estos ya son 500, que podrían agrandar o no la lista de los 32 ya confirmados.

La comisión está conformada por un grupo de expertos y tiene el objetivo de analizar todos los casos reportados como posible sarampión. Con este fin, los expertos se reúnen semanalmente para confirmar los que ya fueron clasificados como tales y analizar las complejidades de los que aún siguen “abiertos”.

La Comisión para la Certificación de la Eliminación de la Circulación Endémica de Sarampión, Rubéola y Síndrome de Rubéola Congénita se encargará de confirmar o descartar los casos sospechosos de sarampión

Por otro lado, esos 32 contagios comprobados se reparten entre la Ciudad, la provincia de Buenos Aires y San Luis. Es una cantidad que podría aumentar dependiendo de las conclusiones a las que lleguen los estudios de la comisión. En total, los notificados como “compatibles con sarampión” fueron 2038. Aunque después se descartaron la mayoría, el sistema de salud está obligado a avisar de estas sospechas al Sistema Nacional de Vigilancia de Salud (SNVS).

El trabajo de los expertos se realizará “en dos líneas”: primero, el examen individual de cada uno de los casos que fueron notificados tras los estudios de laboratorio y a partir de criterios clínicos y epidemiológicos; luego, la construcción de lineamientos y criterios de evaluación, con base en casos testigos, que se hará en conjunto con las jurisdicciones, para que estas puedan avanzar internamente en el cierre de los posibles contagios que no se analicen en comisión.

A partir de esta metodología se sumarán también semanalmente las confirmaciones y se publicarán en el Boletín Epidemiológico Nacional. A través de un comunicado, Salud destacó que “esto no representa un aumento en la circulación del virus, sino un ajuste en la cantidad de los casos que ocurrieron en el pasado”.

Cuando en marzo pasado empezaron campañas de concientización, la cartera sanitaria contó a este medio que en 2024 distribuyeron 1.100.000 dosis de vacunas a las provincias. “Estamos haciendo una compra de urgencia a la OPS [Organización Panamericana de la Salud] . Tenemos una compra de 500.000 dosis de calendario con entrega en octubre, pero queremos recibir una ahora. Hay 280.000 dosis sin usar en las provincias, y estamos preguntándoles cuántas tiene cada una para reasignarlas a las que necesitan reforzar la vacunación”, señalaron en ese momento.

Pero a causa de los brotes, los ministerios de salud (nacional, provincial y de la ciudad de Buenos Aires) definieron implementar una estrategia que focaliza la doble vacunación en el AMBA. Según la página oficial, la estrategia “tiene como objetivo interrumpir la cadena de transmisión, proteger a los grupos vulnerables y fortalecer la inmunidad colectiva frente al sarampión en el contexto del brote actual. Para ello, se utilizará la vacuna doble viral (que protege contra el sarampión y la rubéola), la cual se distribuirá exclusivamente para este contexto de emergencia epidemiológica”.

Pese a esto, un problema persistente es la baja concurrencia de vacunación que hubo, por lo menos, hasta fines de mayo pasado. Para entonces, solo el 16,3% de la población de 6 meses a 5 años se había inoculado, una brecha etaria que conforma el objetivo principal.
 
De hecho, según la misma página oficial, los grupos de 6 a 11 meses deben recibir una dosis de la doble viral; los de 12 meses, la vacuna triple viral (TV) correspondiente al Calendario Nacional de Vacunación (CNV) y citar al mes para recibir la dosis de la campaña de control de brote; entre los 13 meses y 4 años y 11 meses deben recibir una dosis adicional de vacuna doble viral; y los de 5 años, la triple viral correspondiente al CNV.

According to ADPH, the case was reported in an unvaccinated person who was not yet eligible for the vaccine. ADPH is working with local medicine providers to identify any other unvaccinated people who may need to receive the measles vaccine.

ADPH said in a statement on their Facebook page that the risk of an outbreak is low right now, but some people will need to be vaccinated as part of the investigation. ""The measles vaccine is safe and highly effective in producing lifelong immunity against this potentially deadly disease. Our citizens can protect themselves and others by ensuring that all eligible persons are vaccinated,"" said ADPH Chief Medical Officer and pediatrician, Dr. Karen Landers.

An investigation is underway, ADPH said.

South Dakota confirms 2nd case of measles in 2025
-------------------------------------------------
The South Dakota Department of Health (DOH) says a second case of measles has been detected in the state in 2025. The DOH sent the announcement out at 4:48 p.m. on Friday [6 Jun 2025], informing the public that there was potential of a measles exposure at 2 locations in Pennington County.

These were the Sam's Club at 925 Eglin St in Rapid City on June 1 [2025] from noon to 6:00 p.m., and the Dakota Premier Medical Clinic at 2006 Mt Rushmore Rd in Rapid City on June 2 from 11:15 a.m. to 3:45 p.m.

The DOH is advising any person who visited those locations during the mentioned time frames that they may have been exposed to measles, and are asked to self-monitor for symptoms of measles for 21 days after the exposure date.

""We are sharing this information to help individuals who may have been exposed take steps to protect their health,"" said State Epidemiologist Joshua Clayton. ""Any South Dakotan who lack immunity from vaccination or past infection can get the MMR vaccine to prevent measles infection and its complications.""

South Dakota's first measles case of 2025 was reported on June 2 [2025], and was identified in a man in Meade County who developed the infection after traveling internationally.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Six total cases of measles were reported in 2024, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH). 2025 has now nearly matched that. As of June 6, the state has reported 5 cases of measles, most which affected one Atlanta-area family that contracted the disease outside the United States.

Two of the family's cases were previously reported in May 2025. The third and newest is from the same family. None of the 3 family members received the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.

More than 95% of the people who receive a single dose of MMR will develop immunity to all 3 viruses, and a second dose boosts immunity, typically enhancing protection to 98%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Individuals who may have been exposed to either of these persons have been given the MMR vaccine or antibodies to help reduce the risk of developing measles and are being monitored for symptoms. Currently, no new cases of measles have been reported in Georgia outside of this family.

Virginia health officials have confirmed a third case of measles, this time in a young child exposed to a previous measles case in the northwestern area of Virginia, according to a statement on Thursday [5 Jun 2025].

Officials said the child, aged under 4 years old, was confirmed in the Charlottesville area. Officials said he had been exposed to a teen who was also confirmed to have measles back on May 23 [2025]. The first exposure case in Virginia was reported in April [2025].

State health officials said the child went to the following places after catching the disease:
- SugarBear Ice Cream, located at 1522 E. High Street in Charlottesville on Saturday, May 31, between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.
- Lowe's Home Improvement, located at 400 Woodbrook Drive in Charlottesville on Sunday, June 1, between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m.

Anyone who has not received a measles vaccine and was in these locations during these times is asked to contact their local doctor or health department as soon as possible and monitor for symptoms for 21 days after initial exposure. Officials said some non-immune individuals could qualify for post-exposure prophylaxis.

Michigan reports 497 pertussis cases in 2025
--------------------------------------------
Michigan has reported 497 cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, in 2025, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS). According to a June 5 [2025] news release from the MDHHS, [the] rise in pertussis cases in Michigan is linked to a decline in DTaP vaccination rates, with only 72.5% of children receiving their recommended doses by the end of 2024, down from 79% in 2014.

""If you or your child has symptoms of whooping cough, isolate the infected person and seek medical treatment, especially if there are signs of respiratory distress,"" advised Kelly Girard.

Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads through coughing or sneezing. It can also be transmitted by touching contaminated objects such as tissues or cups. The disease can cause severe coughing fits that last for weeks or months, and it is particularly dangerous for infants and people with weakened immune systems. Early symptoms of pertussis resemble those of a common cold, but later symptoms can include uncontrolled coughing fits and vomiting. Infants may not cough but can experience pauses in breathing, known as apnea, which can lead to bluish skin or shortness of breath.

Vaccination is the best protection against pertussis, with doctors recommending the DTaP vaccine for children at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months, with a booster at 4-6 years. Protection from the childhood vaccine decreases over time, so older children and adults, including pregnant women, should receive a Tdap booster shot. With vaccination rates declining, health officials emphasize the importance of immunization to prevent the spread of pertussis and protect vulnerable populations.

Whooping cough cases rise in Iowa
---------------------------------
If you've got a cough that won't go away, you're not alone -- the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is warning about a summer increase in whooping cough, also known as pertussis.

Pertussis is a highly infectious bacterial infection that can leave people coughing for 2 to 3 weeks, and in more severe cases, up to 3 months, according to HHS. In Polk County, 19 people were confirmed or pending diagnosis of whooping cough over March, April and May 2025, says Addie Olson, spokesperson for the county health department. No one was diagnosed with it during that same period last year [2024].

Statewide, there were 114 cases of whooping cough from January through April this year [2025] compared to just 14 at this same time in 2024. There have been 8485 cases reported nationally in 2025 as of April, per the AP [Associated Press]. That is twice as many as this time in 2024.

Polk County had 95 cases in 2024, with diagnoses starting in late summer and fall. Meanwhile, there were fewer than 5 annual cases from 2021 to 2023.

Pertussis is a cyclical infection and outbreaks occur every 3 to 5 years. Last year's [2024] outbreak was compounded by an annual decrease in Polk County kids who were up to date on their vaccinations. In Polk County public and private schools, 2682 students were not fully vaccinated in 2020. That rose to 5516 in 2024.

Officials confirm first cases of the measles in Arizona this year
-----------------------------------------------------------------
For the first time in 2025, Arizona has cases of the measles. State and county officials said on Monday [9 Jun 2025] they have confirmed 4 cases of the virus in Navajo County. The 4 people weren't immunized and have recently traveled out of the country, officials said. They [were] exposed ""through a single source,"" Navajo County said.

The Navajo County Public Health Services District and the Arizona Department of Health Services are working to determine where the patients may have been and exposed others and to notify others of possible exposure. People who may have been exposed to the measles will have to look out for symptoms for 21 days following the exposure period and avoid public places.

Common symptoms include:
- High fever (over 101°F)
- Cough
- Runny nose
- Red or watery eyes
- Rash beginning at the head and spreading downward

Health officials say getting immunized is the most effective way to protect yourself and your loved ones from the measles, which is highly contagious.

So for this year [2025], the United States has seen more than 1000 measles cases, with 775 of them being in Texas. It's the second most active year for measles since 2000.

West Sacramento resident becomes 13th California measles case this year; did not travel abroad
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A West Sacramento resident was diagnosed with measles and may have exposed the virus to others while getting medical care at Sutter Davis Hospital in Davis, Yolo County health officials said on Friday [6 Jun 2025]. The affected adult, whose vaccination status is unknown, is now the 13th confirmed case of measles in California so far in 2025. Last year [2024], Yolo County recorded 2 cases of residents with measles who had traveled internationally. But the county has otherwise not seen a measles case since 2015.

""This case of measles in our community is a good reminder that while international travelers and those traveling to outbreak areas within the United States are at highest risk of measles, residents can also encounter measles during travel to non-outbreak areas or even within our local community,"" Yolo County Public Health Officer Dr. Aimee Sisson said in a statement. ""It is important to check your measles vaccination status to make sure you are protected against measles infection.""

The person may have been exposed via air travel to a state with a known outbreak or could have contracted the virus locally, the county said.

There have been over 1000 cases of measles so far this year, compared to 285 cases for all of 2024. Most of the cases are linked to domestic transmission in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. About 96% of cases involve those who were unvaccinated or their vaccination status is unknown. In California's cases, 10 have been linked to international travel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) has confirmed 19 cases of measles across the state. In the department's most recent update, OSDH says the number of cases is split into 16 confirmed and 3 probable cases. A probable case means a person has symptoms consistent with the national standard definition of measles, but does not have a confirmed test result or is linked to another positive test, according to state health officials. According to the department, all cases, except for one, were from people with no record of vaccines before exposure.

Measles case confirmed in eastern Iowa
--------------------------------------

Iowa Health and Human Services (HHS) confirmed a man in eastern Iowa has tested positive for measles. State officials have not provided specifics on where he is from. However, they did confirm the man is between the ages of 18 and 40, and is vaccinated. It is unclear if the man did any traveling before the positive test.

In May 2025, the state confirmed its first case of measles in central Iowa. This second confirmed case is the first in eastern Iowa.

[It is not stated what county of eastern Iowa that case occurred in or the circumstances of acquisition. Curiously, that information was not given for the first case either.

If the person received 2 doses of vaccine, also not stated, some cases may still occur (the vaccine is about 97% effective), but data suggest the transmission risk from those cases is less:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
---------
""Measles in persons with secondary vaccination failure (SVF) may be less infectious than cases in unvaccinated persons. Our systematic review aimed to assess transmission risk for measles after SVF. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from their inception dates. Inclusion criteria were articles describing persons who were exposed to measles-infected persons who had experienced SVF. Across the included 14 studies, >3030 persons were exposed to measles virus from SVF cases, of whom 180 were susceptible, indicating secondary attack rates of 0%-6.25%. We identified 109 cases of SVF from the studies; 10.09% (n = 11) of case-patients transmitted the virus, resulting in 23 further cases and yielding an effective reproduction number of 0.063 (95% CI 0.0-0.5). These findings suggest a remarkably low attack rate for SVF measles cases, suggesting that, In outbreak situations, public health management of unvaccinated persons could be prioritized over persons with SVF."" - Mod.LL]

People were exposed to measles at a Rochester Hills medical office, Oakland Co. warns
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People who visited a Rochester Hills medical office building last week may have been exposed to measles, the Oakland County Health Division warned. Anyone who visited the medical office building at 3950 South Rochester Road between 8 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. on June 3 [2025] may have been exposed, the division said in a Friday press release [6 Jun 2025].

People who are considered high-risk -- such as pregnant women, unvaccinated children under 5 and people with weakened immune systems -- can seek immune globulin treatment, which is effective if administered within 6 days of exposure, the health division said. People who were exposed but are not high-risk should monitor for symptoms through June 24 [2025]. If symptoms develop, they should call their health care provider.

Michigan has had 10 confirmed cases of measles this year [2025], according to a Michigan Department of Health and Human Services dashboard last updated June 2. The state health department is monitoring for spread of the virus in the eastern Upper Peninsula, where people with measles may have exposed others.

Nationwide, there have been 1168 measles cases in the United States so far in 2025, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which updated its figures on June 6. There have been 3 confirmed deaths.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Colorado reported 2 more cases of measles Monday [9 Jun 2025] and warned that people who visited the emergency rooms at 3 hospitals last week may have been exposed. Among the newly infected are a 5-year-old child from El Paso County who had recently traveled to Ontario, Canada, where there is an ongoing measles outbreak. The other new case is in an adult from Arapahoe County who was at Denver International Airport on the same day an infectious traveler landed at the airport aboard a Turkish Airlines flight. The person is the eighth known infection in a Colorado resident linked to the flight.

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) said in a news release that the adult was unvaccinated and the child was vaccinated with one dose of MMR vaccine. Children typically receive their first dose of MMR after they turn 1 and a second dose between 4 and 6.

Colorado has now recorded 14 cases of measles in 2025, more than double all of the cases reported in the previous decade, combined. In newly released data, CDPHE reported that there have been 3 hospitalizations and no deaths. Eight of those infected have been unvaccinated. The 2 new cases are tied to 5 locations where they may have exposed others, including 3 hospitals and an urgent care clinic.

UKHSA probes rise in hepatitis A cases
--------------------------------------

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is looking into an increase in hepatitis A cases. UKHSA and other health agencies are investigating 2 clusters of hepatitis A virus (HAV) with dozens of confirmed patients.

In the first, 31 people were sick with 23 in England, 7 in Scotland, and 1 in Northern Ireland. Some are secondary infections. Cases have been reported across England in regions such as the South West, East, West Midlands, and London. Sample dates range from January 2021 to March 1, 2025, but 23 cases have been recorded since August 2024. [A total of] 19 people have been hospitalized but no deaths have been reported.

There are 15 women and 16 men sick. They have an age range of 5 to 80 with a median of 50 years old. The most affected group is people aged 50 to 69. Analysis of patient questionnaires suggests a foodborne source. A food item from an unnamed supermarket is suspected as a possible vehicle of transmission because of its frequently reported consumption. Epidemiological and virological investigations are ongoing with Public Health Scotland leading the incident management team. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is also involved in the efforts.

In the second cluster, 64 people are ill with 57 in England, 4 in Northern Ireland, and 3 in Scotland. Sample dates range from January 2023 to March 2025, but 53 cases have been seen since December 2024. Only 7 people recorded international travel in the 50 days before symptom onset. In total, 37 women and 27 men are sick. Cases have an age range of 3 to 80 with a median of 32 years old. No deaths have been recorded but 39 people have been hospitalized.

[Editado por Jaime Torres]


La Consejería de Salud y Consumo de Andalucía ha reportado la confirmación de dos nuevos casos de sarampión, lo que eleva el total a 86 en lo que va del año. Estos últimos contagios se han registrado en Cuevas de Almanzora y Chirivel, ambos municipios almerienses, aunque aún se investiga la fuente de infección.

Según los datos proporcionados por la Dirección General de Salud Pública y Ordenación Farmacéutica, el 24% de los casos han sido importados, originándose principalmente en Marruecos (17 casos), así como uno en Bélgica, otro en Dinamarca y uno más en el Reino Unido. En cuanto a los casos no importados, se han identificado 22 contagios aislados sin una fuente clara de infección.

De los 86 casos reportados hasta ahora, nueve corresponden a menores de un año. El 32% son niños menores de 15 años y el 68% son adultos con edades entre 15 y 70 años. Solo dos pacientes (equivalente al 2%) contaban con un antecedente documentado de vacunación con una dosis, mientras que el resto no estaba vacunado o su situación vacunal es desconocida. Además, el 29% de estos casos requirió hospitalización.

En lo que respecta a los brotes activos, actualmente hay tres en curso: uno en Vera con dos casos confirmados (uno procedente de Marruecos), otro en Vélez-Málaga también con dos casos importados y un tercer brote en Torrox que suma cuatro contagios. En total, desde el inicio del año se han declarado doce brotes, de los cuales nueve ya han sido cerrados.

Desde enero, Almería ha acumulado 17 casos; Granada ha reportado cuatro; Huelva suma 16; y Málaga lidera la lista con un total de 48 contagios. Sevilla ha registrado un único caso. La mayoría de las infecciones se concentran en adultos y están relacionadas con viajes a Marruecos.

A pesar del aumento inicial en la incidencia del sarampión, las últimas semanas muestran una tendencia a la baja en nuevos contagios. Sin embargo, las autoridades sanitarias advierten sobre la posibilidad de futuros brotes debido a la estacionalidad del virus durante la primavera.

Ante esta situación epidemiológica, Salud y Consumo enfatiza la importancia de mantener actualizadas las vacunas tanto en niños como en adultos que no estén inmunizados. Esto es esencial para proteger a aquellos individuos que no pueden recibir la vacuna.

La preocupación por el sarampión no se limita a Andalucía; España había reportado hasta principios de junio un total de 303 casos. A nivel europeo, varios países también enfrentan brotes significativos este año.

Marruecos ha experimentado un gran brote desde octubre pasado, con más de 40.000 casos notificados y una reciente disminución tras una campaña nacional de vacunación. Por su parte, Estados Unidos ha registrado más de mil contagios hasta mayo, mientras que Vietnam enfrenta un resurgimiento del virus con nuevas infecciones notificadas recientemente.

The WHO on Wednesday [28 May 2025] sounded alarm on the rising cases of measles in the Western Pacific Region, particularly the Philippines, Cambodia, Mongolia, and Viet Nam, and the falling coverage of vaccines.

According to WHO, Philippines, Cambodia, Mongolia, and Viet Nam recorded a sharp increase in cases of measles in the first months of 2025 compared to the same period last year [2024].

Viet Nam reported 81 691 suspected measles cases in 63 provinces and cities since the beginning of 2025, while Cambodia logged 2150 cases of measles between January and April 2025. Mongolia recorded 2682 confirmed cases as of 21 May [2025].

""Measles cases across the region are now at their highest level since 2020,"" the WHO said in a statement.

The WHO also emphasized that measles can result in serious complications to children's health such as pneumonia, brain damage, and lifelong disability.

WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific Dr. Saia Piukala said that the alarming rise of measles cases ""highlights the vulnerable children who are being left behind -- those who haven't received even a single dose of vaccine, living in underserved communities, missed by routine immunization and vaccination campaigns.""

DOH's immunization program
As the WHO observed declining vaccine trust and coverage in the Western Pacific Region, the DOH Secretary Teodoro Herbosa affirmed the agency's commitment to strengthen routine immunization in the Philippines during the recently concluded 78th World Health Assembly in Switzerland.

""Routine vaccination should be done faster, higher, stronger, and together,"" Herbosa said in his closing remarks in the assembly.

Data from the DOH showed that as of February 2025, the nationwide Fully Immunized Child coverage, or children receiving all recommended vaccines before their first birthday, only reached 64.58%. The annual immunization coverage goal of the WHO and DOH is at 95%.

The DOH noted that the ""Bakuna BayaniJuan: Big Catch-up Immunization"" program, launched in the National Capital Region from 17 Nov to 16 Dec 2024, vaccinated 1 753 950 individuals.

UNICEF raises alarm over polio variant in Kano
----------------------------------------------

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has raised concern over the detection of a variant of the polio virus in 4 local government areas in Kano State.

The Chief of UNICEF Field Office in Kano, Rahama Mohammed, disclosed this on Thursday [12 Jun 2025] during the June Edition of the Media Dialogue on Polio and Routine Immunisation.

Mr Mohammed said surveillance conducted in 2025 revealed the presence of the virus in Warawa, Bunkure, Kano Municipal, and Nasarawa local government areas of the state. ""This is unacceptable and must be halted. Polio remains a highly infectious disease that spreads rapidly and knows no borders,"" he said.

Mr Mohammed said a single case of polio anywhere poses a threat to children everywhere and called for coordinated efforts to contain the outbreak. He urged governments at all levels, traditional rulers, and the media to intensify awareness campaigns and ensure full vaccination coverage, particularly in high-risk areas.

Mr Mohammed reiterated UNICEF's commitment to support Nigeria's polio eradication efforts and called for the timely release of counterpart funding and stronger supervision of immunisation campaigns.

Nigeria was declared wild polio-free in 2020 by the World Health Organisation, but hundreds of cases of the vaccine-derived type have been reported since. Although millions of Nigerian children receive the polio vaccine annually, insecurity and vaccine hesitancy mean many children do not get vaccinated.

In an interview with PT Health Watch, Christiana Fashola, a global digital health and vaccine expert with experience across Africa, Central Asia, and Latin America, said Nigeria must evolve its immunisation strategy to close coverage gaps and protect more children from preventable diseases.

Ms Fashola explained that the most effective immunisation strategies are context-specific, tailored to a country's disease burden, health infrastructure, and target groups. She said that while mass campaigns, routine outreach, and scheduled immunisation days have helped Nigeria expand coverage, these tools are no longer enough.

""There's a growing need to expand beyond these traditional strategies by leveraging community-based service delivery models,"" she said.

At the media dialogue in Kano, the Director-General of the State Primary Health Care Management Board, Nasiru Mahmud, reaffirmed the state government's commitment to eradicate polio by December 2025.

Mr Mahmud said the State government has set a target to vaccinate 3.9 million children under the age of 5 during the June 2025 Outbreak Response (OBR) campaign. He explained that the campaign aligned with the national strategy to eradicate polio and maintain Nigeria's polio-free certification.

He said that the vaccination drive became necessary due to the recent resurgence of the type 2 poliovirus in parts of the state. According to him, factors such as community resistance, poor data reporting, and insecurity have contributed to the virus's re-emergence by hindering previous immunisation efforts.

""Ungogo Local Government Area recorded the highest level of non-compliance during the May 2025 campaign. To improve vaccination coverage, local government areas are now ranked monthly based on performance,"" he said.

Mr Mahmud also pledged to drastically reduce the state's maternal mortality rate within the same period, describing the fight against both health challenges as top priorities. He stressed the government's resolve to work closely with traditional rulers and the 44 local government chairmen to address the issues.

Ростовская область заняла пятое место среди российских регионов по количеству случаев заболеваемости корью в прошлом году. Согласно данным Роспотребнадзора, зафиксировано 1 639 заболевших, что составляет 39,41 случая на сто тысяч населения. Показатель в 18 раз превышает среднемноголетние значения и более чем вчетверо выше уровня 2023 г.
Детские возрастные группы оказались наиболее уязвимыми перед инфекцией. Две трети всех заболевших несовершеннолетние до 18 лет. Наибольшую опасность корь представляет для младенцев до года. По стране в этой категории зафиксирован рекордный показатель - 166,19 случаев на сто тысяч детей, что в 2,2 раза больше, чем в 2023 г.
Главной причиной стремительного распространения болезни специалисты называют недостаточный охват вакцинацией.

-----------------------------------------------------------
В нескольких жилых домах на юге Москвы выявлены очаги кори. Об этом сообщили «Вести». По данным медиков, большинство заболевших не имели прививки.
Врачи предупредили, что болезнь особенно тяжело переносят взрослые - у них чаще развиваются осложнения. Врачи призвали пройти вакцинацию, чтобы защитить себя и окружающих. За неделю до этого единичный случай заражения корью выявили в детском саду при школе №1450 «Олимп» на юге Москвы.
Из-за подобных случаев студентов нескольких московских вузов временно перевели на дистанционное обучение. Так, в мае стало известно, что более трех тысяч студентов гуманитарного корпуса Московского государственного университета имени М.В.

В Приморье заболеваемость корью выросла в четыре раза: 80 % заболевших не привиты
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
В Приморском крае зафиксирован резкий рост заболеваемости корью – число случаев увеличилось в четыре раза за год. По данным Роспотребнадзора, в 2024 г. у выявлено 75 заболевших (против 19 в 2023-м), при этом большая часть случаев связана с отказом от прививок. Параллельно в регионе растет число заражений паротитом, гепатитом В и кишечными инфекциями.
«В Приморском крае фиксируется рост заболеваемости рядом вирусных инфекций. В том числе растет число пациентов с диагнозами, которые ранее почти исчезли с территории региона благодаря массовой вакцинации», – пишет РБК Приморье.
По данным регионального Роспотребнадзора, в 2024 году в Приморском крае зарегистрировано 75 случаев кори, что в четыре раза превышает показатели предыдущего года (19 случаев). Уровень заболеваемости достиг 4,28 случаев на 100 тысяч населения, что в 14,4 раза выше среднемноголетних значений. Особую тревогу вызывает тот факт, что 80 % заболевших не были привиты из-за отказа родителей. Хотя первичная вакцинация детей в возрасте 1 года охватывает 95,1 % населения, уровень ревакцинации среди шестилетних детей составляет лишь 90,9 % при необходимых 95 %.
Специалисты Роспотребнадзора отмечают серьезные проблемы с вакцинацией среди мигрантов 18-35 лет и труднодоступных групп населения. Ведомство подчеркивает необходимость усиления взаимодействия с религиозными общинами и общественными организациями для повышения охвата прививками.

Young adult in the Netherlands dies from measles, health institute confirms
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

An adult in the Netherlands died this week as a result of a measles infection, Dutch public health institute RIVM announced on Thursday [12 Jun 2025]. It was the first person in the country to die from the disease in over 2 years, and the last time an adult died from the viral infection was many years before that. The death was reported amid long-running concerns about declining vaccination rates.

The person who died this week suffered from a serious immune disorder, the institute said. An investigation into the source of the patient's infection has not determined where or how the person contracted the virus. Information regarding their age, gender and hometown was not disclosed, though the RIVM did confirm to broadcaster NOS that the individual was a young adult.

""The patient was admitted to the hospital with measles 2 weeks ago,"" the RIVM said. ""The effect of a previous vaccination can be greatly reduced in people with a serious immune disorder, such as a congenital immune disorder or a medical treatment that severely suppresses the immune system.

A child died from the viral infection at the RadboudUMC hospital in Nijmegen in March 2023, which was the first measles-related death in the Netherlands since 2019. During the last major outbreak in the Netherlands in 2013 and 2014, one 17-year-old girl died from the virus, and over 180 were hospitalized. Another individual died years later from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. ""This is a form of encephalitis caused by measles that only occurs several years after infection,"" the RIVM said.

So far this year [2025], a total of 437 confirmed measles cases have been diagnosed in the Netherlands. That was more than double the total of 204 reported all of last year [2024]. Roughly 2800 cases were diagnosed during the last major outbreak, and around 3300 were reported during the 1999-2000 outbreak.

""This tragic event emphasises the importance of a high vaccination rate,"" the RIVM said. It is the only way to offer protection from the virus to children who are not yet at vaccination age, and those with an immune deficiency. ""It also shows that measles is not just a childhood disease; it can also have major consequences for vulnerable adults.""

Doctors in the Netherlands have repeatedly raised concerns about faltering child vaccination rates, particularly since the coronavirus pandemic. Data related to the mumps, measles and rubella combination vaccine show that 2 different municipalities have rates below 60%, 5 more below 70%, and 9 others below 80%. Amsterdam's vaccination rate is 83.2%, similar to The Hague, and slightly better than Rotterdam.

""Over the past 10 years, the vaccination rate has clearly decreased, which means that the disease can now spread more easily again. Especially among people who are not vaccinated and have not had measles before,"" the RIVM said.

Possible hepatitis A exposure reported at Regina McDonald's
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) is reporting potential hepatitis A exposure at a McDonald's in east Regina. A food handler at the McDonald's location at 2002 Aurora Boulevard was reportedly at risk of transmitting the virus to food served there from May 25 to June 5 [2025].

The SHA says anyone worried they may have been exposed should call 811 to reach the Saskatchewan HealthLine to be assessed for symptoms. If eligible, they can receive a vaccination against hepatitis A from local health services. They are also advised to monitor for symptoms for up to 50 days.

Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, vomiting and diarrhea. It also may cause jaundice, which is the yellowing of the eyes and skin. The risk of transmission for the virus is very low, but it is still possible.

Perth Airport named measles exposure site after highly infectious virus confirmed in overseas traveler
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Travelers and visitors to Perth Airport last week have been urged to monitor for measles symptoms after a case was confirmed in an overseas traveler. The person was infectious on board Qantas flight QF10 from London to Perth -- a near 18-hour flight -- which landed at Perth International Airport on June 6 [2025], about 11:40 am. Authorities say those passing through Qantas terminals T3 and T4 for the next 2 hours should monitor for symptoms.

Passengers on domestic flight QF938 to Brisbane, which left Perth at 1:05 pm [6 Jun 2025] and arrived in the Queensland capital at 7:10 pm may also have been exposed to the highly infectious virus.

Communicable Diseases acting director Rebecca Hogan said the terminals pose no further risk, but anyone on the affected flights or in the area at the time should be on the lookout for symptoms. ""This is a timely reminder to the community to make sure they are up to date with their vaccinations, particularly if they are planning overseas travel,"" Dr Hogan said. ""Babies can also have their first dose of the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine from 6 months of age if they are traveling to a country with high levels of measles activity.""

It usually takes about 10 days for symptoms to manifest after exposure to measles but can take up to 18 days. The latest case brings [Western Australia]'s total for the year to 20 after an outbreak in March 2025 sparked at least 17 cases. Just 6 months into the year, it's more than triple the number of cases in the State in 2024, when 6 cases were confirmed.

Those not fully immunized against measles are at risk of catching the highly infectious virus, which can become life-threatening if left untreated. People unsure of their vaccination status or who are planning overseas travel should see their GP to discuss vaccinations.

Exposure locations:
- Qantas flight QF10: departed London (Heathrow) at 11:55 am (local time) and arrived at Perth International Airport (T3) Friday, June 6 at 11:40 am
- Perth Airport (Qantas terminals T3/T4): from 11:40 am to 1:35 pm Friday, June 6
- Qantas flight QF938: departed Perth Domestic Airport (T4) at 1:05 pm and arrived in Brisbane at 7:10 pm Friday, June 6.

Hepatitis A outbreak in Kerala: What's causing it and how to stay safe
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Kerala is currently witnessing a steep rise in hepatitis A infections, especially in districts like Ernakulam, Malappuram, Kozhikode, and Thrissur. This trend has brought growing concern for public health, particularly with the onset of monsoon season. With the incubation period of hepatitis A virus being 2 to 6 weeks, health authorities expect more cases to surface, especially following reports of events where contaminated water and food were consumed.
 
Rising Hepatitis A case numbers spark alarm in Kerala
- 3227 confirmed cases and 16 deaths recorded state-wide by 16 Apr 2025
- Sharp increase from 7943 cases and 81 deaths in 2024
- In May 2025 alone, more than 50 hepatitis cases reported

What is driving the rise in hepatitis A infections?

Unsafe drinking water from contaminated sources
-----------------------------------------------
Heavy reliance on poorly chlorinated or untreated water -- especially during summer and monsoon -- leads to faecal contamination of drinking water, fuelling infection.

Intense rains can cause flooding, creating mixing zones for sewage and drinking water.

Water scarcity during summer, followed by erratic supply during monsoon, increases consumption of riskier sources.

Low adult immunity increases hepatitis A vulnerability
------------------------------------------------------
With better hygiene and fewer exposures in childhood, more adults now lack immunity, making them vulnerable.

People with liver issues, diabetes, fatty liver, or alcoholism face greater risk of complications and death.

Poor sanitation and leaking sewage systems
------------------------------------------
Open drains, leaking pipelines, and illegal dumping contaminate water supplies -- experts emphasise the urgent need for improved sanitation.

What are the symptoms of hepatitis A to watch for?
--------------------------------------------------
Typical symptoms include:
- Fever and fatigue
- Nausea
- Abdominal pain
- Headache
- Lethargy
- Diarrhoea
- Jaundice (yellowing of eyes/skin)

Symptoms may surface 15-60 days post-infection. Infected individuals should avoid contact with others for 1 to 2 weeks after the symptoms appear.

What steps are authorities taking to control the outbreak?
----------------------------------------------------------
- Chlorination of water supplies: Super-chlorinators are being deployed in affected areas.
- Restaurant inspections: Stricter hygiene norms, including mandatory health cards for food handlers and boiled water usage.
- Protective gear advisory: Those involved in dairy farming and indoor cleaning must use protective gumboots and gloves.
- Public advisories: Wash hands thoroughly and avoid stale or uncovered foods.
 
Emphasising the need for vigilance, District Medical Officer T.P. Sreedevi said, ""Only boiled and properly treated water should be used for drinking. Avoid stale food at all costs.""
 
""While health authorities are super-chlorinating water sources in affected areas, this alone won't curb the outbreak,"" said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, convenor of the Indian Medical Association Research Cell. ""Isolated measures aren't enough -- sewage contamination of drinking water remains a major concern. We need sustained, scientific efforts to clean and safeguard water sources. Curbing illegal waste dumping and adopting proven septic waste disposal methods is critical to long-term prevention,"" he added.

How can individuals and families protect themselves?
----------------------------------------------------
- Drink only boiled, filtered, or purified water; avoid ice from untrusted sources.
- Wash hands with soap before meals and after using the restroom.
- Eat freshly cooked, properly covered food; wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly.
- Consider getting a hepatitis A vaccine, especially if you haven't been previously infected.
- Be alert for early symptoms and consult a doctor promptly--self-medication can worsen outcomes. ...

Reunion Island: vaccination strongly recommended
---------------------------------------------
The circulation of [pertussis] has been increasing significantly in Reunion Island for several months. In the first half of 2025, 70 cases were reported to the ARS [Agence Regionale de Sante (Regional Health Agency)], compared to 17 over the same period in 2024, an increase of nearly 300%. Of these cases, 36% concern children under 5 years old, and severe forms have been reported, including the recent death of a hospitalized infant.

Faced with this situation, the ARS La RÃ©union reminds that vaccination remains the best protection against severe forms, particularly for infants and pregnant women.

What is [pertussis]?
----------------
It is a highly contagious respiratory bacterial infection that is transmitted by coughing or sneezing. It is classically manifested by
- [severe] and repeated coughing fits, which can last several weeks, and
- vomiting triggered by coughing.

Treatment is based on taking [antimicrobials], sometimes in hospital, especially for children under 3 months.

Vaccination: The only way to protect against [pertussis]
---------------------
Severe forms can develop in unvaccinated people at risk (newborns, pregnant women, immunocompromised people, etc.) and can lead to hospitalization.

Vaccination against whooping cough therefore concerns the entire population.

Infants:
Primary vaccination is mandatory from the age of 2 months, and the administration of iterative boosters is recommended until adulthood (see: Vaccination Info Service at <https://vaccination-info-service.fr/Les-maladies-et-leurs-vaccins/Coqueluche> [in French]). Infants under 6 months of age are most at risk of complications and severe forms of the disease and a risk of death. However, it is observed that only 89.4% of infants received 3 doses of the hexavalent vaccine (DTP, [poliovirus], hepatitis B, _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b) in 2024 in Reunion Island.

Pregnant women:
Vaccination is recommended from the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, and at the latest one month before delivery. If the mother has not been vaccinated during pregnancy, she must be vaccinated before discharge from the maternity ward, even if breastfeeding, and up to the first 6 months of the baby's life.

Adults:
A booster is to be given at the age of 25 (except in the case of vaccination that is less than 5 years old). The booster is strongly recommended for anyone in close contact with newborns and/or infants under 6 months of age, if the last vaccination is more than 5 years old (so-called cocooning strategy). A booster at age 45 is recommended, then every 10 years from age 65.

В Монголии число зараженных корью граждан превысило семь тысяч
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Как сообщили в национальном центре инфекционных заболеваний, медики наблюдают за более чем 63 тыс. человек, активно контактировавших с больными
Число подтвержденных случаев кори выросло в Монголии с 6 836 до 7 717 за 4 дня. Об этом сообщил национальный центр инфекционных заболеваний.
""Закрытие на каникулы школ, где наиболее часто заражались корью, не повлияло на снижение заболеваемости. Если корь была подтверждена 12 июня у 6 836 граждан, то по состоянию на 16 июня число зараженных выросло до 7 717. Под наблюдением медиков находятся 63 052 человек, активно контактировавших с больными"", - привело данные медицинское ведомство.
Оно напомнило, что к середине июня в стране зарегистрированы пять летальных исходов от кори. Ранее ведомство сообщило о том, что не в состоянии справиться с наплывом граждан, которые выстраиваются в очередь со своими детьми в ожидании экстренной помощи.
Первые зараженные корью граждане прибыли в Улан-Батор зарубежными авиарейсами в конце февраля 2025 года. В последний раз в стране вспышка этой болезни среди детей была зафиксирована в марте 2019 года, хотя Всемирная организация здравоохранения в 2016 году признала Монголию страной, ликвидировавшей корь.

Imo government shuts schools over diphtheria outbreak in Orlu
-------------------------------------------------------------

A fresh outbreak of diphtheria in Imo State has claimed the lives of 3 school pupils -- a girl and 2 boys -- over the weekend in the Amihie Ward, Obibi Ochasi, Okwuabala, and Ihiteowere areas of Orlu Local Council.

In response, the Imo State government has ordered the immediate closure of all schools in the affected vicinity. The Commissioner for Primary and Secondary Education, Prof. B.T.O. Ikegwuoha, announced the measure in a statement issued yesterday [15 Jun 2025], confirming preliminary findings of the disease's resurgence in the region.

According to Ikegwuoha, the outbreak is concentrated in several parts of Orlu, including Amihie Ward, Ogberuru, and Obibi Ochasi. He revealed that 3 fatalities have been confirmed so far, while 3 additional cases have been reported within families in the Okwuabala and Ihiteowere areas.

""The reported outbreak of diphtheria has led to the deaths of 3 children in Orlu Council, and as a precautionary measure, all schools in affected communities are temporarily closed,"" Ikegwuoha said. He urged principals, headmistresses, parents, and guardians to adhere strictly to the closure directive.

This latest outbreak follows an initial case reported 3 weeks ago in Aboh Mbaise Local Council, which resulted in 6 fatalities and a temporary shutdown of schools in the area. Those schools were reopened only last week after the disease was reportedly contained.

The commissioner explained that the closure decision was made in consultation with Governor Hope Uzodimma and the Executive Chairman of Orlu Council, Pastor Chris Mbarie. He emphasised the need to err on the side of caution to safeguard pupils and students in the affected areas.

""All schools in and around Obibi Ochasi, Ogberuru, Okwuabala, Ihioma Clan, Ihitenansa, Asaa Ubirielem, Umuhu Okabia, and adjoining communities are hereby closed until further notice,"" Ikegwuoha stated.

The commissioner added that the precautionary measure was necessary to protect the health and safety of the public. ""This decision underscores the importance of timely action to contain the disease and ensure the well-being of all citizens,"" he said.

Unvaccinated visitor infected with measles triggers contact tracing in Boston
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
An unvaccinated individual infected with measles visited several locations in Boston last week triggering a public health response to identify and notify potentially exposed residents and travelers.

The Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) confirmed that the individual, who was in the city on 7 and 8 Jun 2025, spent time at ""several places"" including:
- Westin Boston Seaport District Hotel (including the restaurants in the hotel) between 5:30 p.m. on 7 Jun 2025 and 1:30 p.m. on Sunday 8 Jun 2025.
- The Museum of Fine Arts Boston between 1 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. on 8 Jun 2025.
- Logan International Airport Terminal C between 5 p.m. and 11:15 p.m. on 8 Jun 2025.

After their visit, the individual departed at 9:12 p.m. from Logan International Airport on JetBlue flight 639 to Miami. Both local and state health agencies are now collaborating with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to trace and inform passengers on that flight.

Measles is a highly contagious virus that begins with flu-like symptoms, including a cough, high fever, runny nose and red, watery eyes, the BPHC wrote. People can then experience a red and blotchy rash that spreads from the face to the rest of the body.

The virus can spread to others from coughing, breathing or sneezing, the BPHC statement added. People can also become infected after touching surfaces or items contaminated with the virus within 2 hours after the infected person was in the area. The infection can occur anywhere from 7 to 21 days after direct or indirect contact with another person infected with measles.

""This case of measles highlights the importance of obtaining the [Measles, Mumps and Rubella] vaccine to protect ourselves and our community,"" Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, commissioner of public health for Boston, said in the statement. ""The MMR vaccine is highly effective at preventing measles infection and also protects against mumps and rubella.""

Measles vaccination is 93% to 97% effective in preventing measles and protecting against severe disease, according to the BPHC.

In Suffolk County, 94% of children have been fully vaccinated against measles, according to state Department of Public Health data.

Children are recommended to receive their vaccine dose at 12 to 15 months of age and again before kindergarten to ensure strong immunity, according to Ojikutu. For infants at least 6 months old traveling internationally, an early dose is advised.

""It is never too late for children or adults to get the measles vaccine and for the vaccine to be effective,"" Ojikutu said in the release. ""...even if they are past the age recommended by doctors.""

Health officials are urging those who do not know their measles immunization status to get vaccinated with at least one dose of the MMR vaccine.

As of 12 Jun 2025, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there were a total of 1197 confirmed measles cases reported by 35 jurisdictions, including Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.

Twelve percent of people infected with the measles were hospitalized and there have been 3 deaths, accoring to the CDC website.

Texas has more than 700 cases, the highest in the U.S. Massachusetts has no cases, according to the CDC.

[2] Virginia: arriving passenger

Outbreak fears at Dulles International Airport as passenger with infectious disease triggers alert
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials have warned of a potential measles outbreak at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia. 

A passenger arriving on an international flight tested positive for the highly contagious respiratory illness, which is currently ripping through the US.

Travelers who were at Washington Dulles airport, which serves the Washington, DC, Virginia and Maryland region, on 8 Jun 2025 have been warned they could be at high risk of the virus.

The infected traveler passed through Concourse A, took transportation to the International Arrivals Building (IAB), and transited through the baggage claim area between 10:30am and 1pm.

In addition, they ventured into Washington DC area on the same day [8 Jun 2025], taking the Silver Line train from Dulles International Airport station to the Red Line, heading towards Shady Grove station between 11:30am and 2:30pm.

Travelers who fear they may have crossed paths with the patient at Washington Dulles and in Washington DC's transit system have been advised to confirm if they have been vaccinated against measles.

To date in 2025, Virginia has 3 reported cases of measles, with another one of these cases also linked to a traveler at Washington Dulles International Airport. 

Experts warn the US is currently vulnerable to measles outbreaks because of falling vaccination rates.

However, the new case comes as Texas is battling a measles outbreak that has infected nearly 800 people and killed 2 children. 

At this time, 744 cases have been confirmed in the Lone Star state since late January [2025].

Ninety-six of the patients have been hospitalized and there have been 2 fatalities in unvaccinated school-aged children who lived in the outbreak area. 

Overall, in the US there have been 1168 confirmed measles cases reported by 34 states and at least 3 deaths.

Measles is the world's most contagious disease -- infecting 9 out of 10 people exposed -- but those who are fully vaccinated are protected in 97% of cases.

The illness causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and a high fever. 

If severe, it can lead to life-threatening pneumonia. 

Children need 2 doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine: the 1st at age 12-15 months, and the 2nd dose at age 4-6 years. 

Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.

About 1 to 3 in 1000 people with measles dies of the illness. 

In an updated advisory, the CDC is warning that people can get infected with measles during travel or at crowded events, unless they are fully vaccinated or have had the disease.

The notice reads: 'Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings, including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.

'Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.' 

The government agency recommends that all travelers be fully vaccinated against measles before traveling to an international destination.

The last time measles was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there were 1274 cases reported for the entire year.

Measles was officially eradicated in the US in 2000 amid a successful vaccination campaign.

At the time, the CDC described achieving measles elimination status in the US as a 'historic public health achievement'. 

However, a recent study found uptake of the vaccine among children declined in 8 in 10 US counties last year [2024], which is being signaled as the cause of the measles resurgence. 

Overall, vaccine rates fell 3% across the country.

It means that 91% of children are vaccinated against measles, which is below the 95% needed to prevent the disease from spreading and causing deaths.

The Johns Hopkins University researchers warned that if vaccination rates continue to fall, measles is likely to return and become a common infection among Americans.

Национальный центр инфекционных заболеваний Монголии предоставил информацию о ситуации с корью. По состоянию на 18 июня 2025 года, общее число лабораторно подтвержденных случаев кори составляет 8154, в том числе 666 госпитализированных, 1210 находящихся на лечении дома, 6272 выздоровевших, 63052 контактных и шесть умерших.
Случаи заболевания в основном сосредоточены в средних школах. Власти призывают родителей, а также всех, кто контактирует, сделать прививку от кори, чтобы предотвратить последующее заражение.
Первые сообщения о подтвержденном диагнозе «корь» появились к концу февраля текущего года. Он был зафиксирован у пассажиров, прибывших рейсом Фукуок-Улан-Батор 18 февраля из Вьетнама. Речь идет об инциденте с пассажирами, прибывшими в Монголию рейсом «VJ3200» из Фукуока в Улан-Батор 18 февраля 2025 года, когда был зафиксирован третий случай заболевания корью у человека, вернувшегося из Вьетнама. Первые два зафиксированы еще 8 февраля у граждан, прибывших рейсом «MIAT OM712» из Хошимина в Улан-Батор. Во всех случаях у пассажиров, прибывших указанными рейсами, проявлялись симптомы лихорадки, сыпи, кашля, насморка и раздражения глаз.
Накануне жителей Бурятии призвали воздержаться от поездок в Монголию из-за вспышек кори.

Gauteng Health sounds alarm over measles outbreak
------------------------------------
The Gauteng Department of Health (GDoH) has intensified its public health response following a continued rise in measles cases across the province.

Motalatale Modiba, head of communications at GDoH, stated that there have been 181 confirmed cases reported between 1 Jan and 13 Jun [2025], with numerous cases emerging from the Johannesburg, Tshwane, and Ekurhuleni districts.

""This persistent outbreak follows previous clusters dating back to 2022, which led to a measles vaccination campaign in 2023. In the latest reporting period, Gauteng recorded 15 new measles cases, 10 of which were reported in Tshwane, 2 in Johannesburg, 2 in Ekurhuleni, and one in West Rand. The outbreak has revealed a concerning immunity gap in the province, specifically among children who are either not fully vaccinated or have never received the measles or rubella vaccine,"" Modiba said.

Modiba added that the immunisation coverage for the second dose of the measles vaccine remains below 75% in Johannesburg, significantly below the level required to prevent outbreaks. This has contributed to the steady increase in cases, including among people who had previously been vaccinated, and even some adults.

""In the Johannesburg district, the department implemented a targeted response by vaccinating contacts and conducting outbreak campaigns in areas including Diepsloot, Midrand, Cosmo City, Hillbrow, and Rosettenville. To date, more than 3500 people have been vaccinated in the district, with further campaigns scheduled for busy community sites including the Diepsloot and Cosmo City taxi ranks.

""The West Rand and Sedibeng districts, while not currently experiencing outbreaks, remain on high alert.

""GDoH is working closely with districts to strengthen surveillance, ensure rapid response, and improve vaccination coverage. The department is expected to embark on a comprehensive 4-week province-wide vaccination campaign as part of broader intervention activities,"" Modiba said.

The Gauteng MEC for Health and Wellness, Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko, has urged all parents and guardians to ensure their children are vaccinated, encouraging them to work with health teams conducting school and community campaigns.

""We must close the immunity gap in our communities and prevent further spread of the highly contagious diseases, particularly measles and rubella.

""Vaccination is simple, safe, and is our best protection against harmful diseases. We encourage everyone to support our outreach teams and protect our children's health,"" Nkomo-Ralehoko stated.

""The public is reminded that people who are infected with measles must isolate at home for at least 7 days to prevent further transmission. All suspected cases are provided with Vitamin A supplements to reduce the risk of complications. The department remains committed to containing the spread of measles and rubella in the province and urges the public to remain vigilant, get vaccinated, and take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and those around them,"" Modiba concluded.

Pakistan reports 12th polio case of 2025
----------------------------------------

Pakistan has reported the 12th polio case of 2025 as a new case of the virus has been detected in a 33-month-old boy from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the National Institute of Health confirmed on Friday [20 Jun 2025].

According to the institute, the case was reported from the Shamsi Khel Union Council in Bannu, with the affected child being a 33-month-old. The latest polio case brought the total number of polio cases in the country this year [2025] to 12.

So far this year [2025], Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has reported 6 cases, while Sindh has recorded 4. Additionally, one case each has been reported from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.

Earlier, the Pakistan-wide anti-polio drive is underway with full momentum, the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) said. According to the NEOC report, 97% of targeted children have been successfully administered the anti-polio vaccine over the 6-day drive.

In Punjab and Sindh, 97% of children have received the vaccine, while the coverage stands at 98% in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 97% in Balochistan.

Azad Jammu and Kashmir achieved a 98% target, and Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad exceeded expectations by vaccinating 101% of the estimated children.

The NEOC also stated that the synchronized polio campaign in both Pakistan and Afghanistan is progressing successfully.

Measles alert: 5 Edmond businesses visited by infected person, exposure notice issued
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A confirmed measles case has led to a public exposure notice for the Edmond area.

The State Department of Health reported that a person with measles visited 5 businesses in Edmond while contagious on 31 May 2025 from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.:
- Eileen's Cookies: 1333 N. Santa Fe
- Walmart Supercenter: 2200 W. Danforth Road
- UPS Store: 2011 W Danforth Road
- Goodwill: 2525 W. Danforth Road
- Tropical Cafe: 2015 W. Danforth Road

If you visited any of those businesses during that time frame and you are not vaccinated against the measles, you could be infected. You are encouraged to complete this form, which can be found on the State Department of Health's website.

Measles cases in Oklahoma were stagnant for the late part of May and early June [2025], but have now increased to 20 across the state. 17 of those cases are confirmed, with 3 cases being probable.

Of the 20 measles cases in Oklahoma, the median age of a person infected was 21 years old. Most were unvaccinated.

First measles case confirmed in Utah amid national outbreaks 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Amid national outbreaks spreading across the nation, Utah has confirmed its 1st case of measles. 

A Utah County adult has been diagnosed with measles, state health officials said on Friday [20 Jun 2025]. The person was unvaccinated and didn't report any out-of-state exposure, meaning that the infection was transmitted within Utah, they warned.

The Utah Department of Health and Human Services said it hasn't identified any other cases in the state as of Friday morning [20 Jun 2025]. However, they're encouraging Utahns who may have been in the same area as the infected person to monitor themselves for symptoms. 

Before the diagnosis and during the illness' infectious period, the Utah County resident visited several public places and medical centers in Orem, including Parkway Health Center on 13 Jun 2025, and the Timpanogos Regional ER, which the patient visited on 14 Jun 2025 from 2:14 p.m. to 7:02 p.m., the department said in a news release. 

""People who were at these sites at the same time or 2 hours after this person could have been exposed to measles,"" the release says. ""We encourage unvaccinated people who were in these locations during the exposure time period to monitor themselves for symptoms.""

The Utah diagnosis comes amid a national spike in measles cases reported in at least 36 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Thursday [19 Jun 2025], there were 1214 confirmed cases across the country and 23 outbreaks reported in 2025.

Measles symptoms typically show up 7 to 14 days after exposure. Symptoms like fever higher than 102.2°F [39 C], cough, runny nose or red eyes may indicate early stages of measles. A rash could appear after 4 days of fever, the Department of Health and Human Services said. 

More than 90% of Utahns are reported to have the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and ""are highly protected against infection,"" according to the department. However, infants younger than age 1 aren't eligible for the immunization and are especially vulnerable to measles.

""The MMR vaccine has been used since the early 1970s. It has saved millions of lives and prevented significant suffering around the world."" Leisha Nolen, Utah Department of Health and Human Services state epidemiologist said in a prepared statement. ""The MMR vaccine is safe and effective. Decades of careful research has shown the benefits of being vaccinated against measles far outweigh any risks the vaccine may pose. We encourage those who are not vaccinated to talk to their doctor about receiving the vaccine.""

'Visitor to BC' infectious with measles says Interior Health
------------------------------------------------------------
Interior Health has issued a health bulletin asking the public to be aware of possible exposure to an individual who has been confirmed to have measles and was infectious while visiting Sparwood on 8 Jun 2025. The health authority is asking those individuals who visited a McDonalds Restaurant in the town on that day between 3-5:30 p.m. to contact it.

Interior Health has noted that while there are no measles cases in Interior Health at this time the health authority ""is following up directly with individuals who are known to have been exposed to complete contact tracing. The risk to the broader public is considered low,"" it said.

New measles cases in the north of the province have brought BC's total up to 30 infections.

Those who have been exposed at the above location and have not been vaccinated against measles or are unsure, are immunocompromised, have an exposed child under one year of age, or are pregnant, are asked to call 1-855-549-6364 to speak with the communicable disease team who will review your vaccine history, determine your immunity to measles, and provide recommendations.

The health authority did not say where the ""visitor to BC"" came from, but Sparwood, which has no commercial airport, is only 41 km [25 mi] from Crowsnest which marks the BC-Alberta border. Alberta, which has among some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, is currently facing surging measles cases, surpassing 900 total cases since the outbreaks began in March [2025].

More than two-thirds of the cases have been detected in the province's southern health region, which includes the communities of Taber, Medicine Hat and Lethbridge.

Provincial data from 2024 shows just 68.1% of Alberta 2-year-olds were up to date with 2 doses of the measles vaccine, in comparison to BC where that number stands at about 82% which is still below the 95% target for herd immunity. And in the Okanagan and Kootenay-Boundary regions less than two-thirds of 7-year-olds were up to date with their measles shots according to data from 2023.

Low vaccine uptake rates in Alberta also have infectious disease specialists concerned about a recurrence of illnesses largely forgotten but with serious consequences such as polio. In 2021 data showed 92% of 2-year-olds had received full polio vaccine doses which dipped to 74.8% by 2023. This decrease concerns specialists as it falls below the 80-86% herd immunity threshold.

Premier Danielle Smith announced on 13 Jun 2025 that funding of the COVID-19 vaccine would be limited to very specific high risk groups. This includes Albertans living in care homes and group settings, those receiving home care, people on social programs, and immunocompromised individuals. Seniors, pregnant Albertans and health-care workers will have to pay for the vaccine themselves, along with the rest of the population.

Meanwhile, anyone who is concerned about exposure to measles should watch for symptoms including: fever, cough, runny nose, and red and inflamed eyes. These are followed by a rash, which starts first on the face and neck, spreads to the chest, arms and legs, and lasts for at least 3 days.

Anyone who thinks they may have been exposed to measles and have developed symptoms should call ahead to the doctor's office or the hospital before visiting, because of the highly infectious nature of measles.

If you think you or a loved one may have been exposed to measles but you have no symptoms, you can call 8-1-1 or your local public health centre to speak to a nurse.

The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones against measles is to ensure vaccinations are up to date. To check your vaccination status visit <interiorhealth.ca/measles>.

You can get the vaccine for free at your local community health centre, or pharmacist (for adults and children over 5).

Measles is a serious illness that is caused by a virus. It is highly contagious and spreads easily through the air. Complications from measles can include pneumonia, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), convulsions (seizures), deafness, brain damage, and death. ...

Measles alert issued in Sydney after traveler from Southeast Asia tests positive
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in New South Wales (NSW) have issued a public alert after a confirmed case of measles was reported in a passenger who travelled through Sydney International Airport while infectious. The traveler, who arrived on Vietnam Airlines flight VN773 from Southeast Asia earlier this week, may have exposed others in the airport's arrival and baggage claim areas between 8:00 and 9:30 am, 16 Jun 2025.

The case comes amid ongoing measles outbreaks in several Southeast Asian countries, health officials said. Authorities are urging anyone who was on that flight or in the airport during that time to stay alert for symptoms and monitor their health until 18 days after potential exposure.

Dr. Mitchell Smith, Acting Director of Public Health for South Western Sydney Local Health District, explained that early symptoms of measles include fever, sore eyes, cough, and a runny nose, followed by a rash that typically starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. ""If you develop any of these symptoms, especially after possible exposure, seek medical attention promptly,"" he advised.

According to Australia's National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, the country has already recorded 80 measles cases in 2025, up from 57 in 2024 and 26 in 2023, showing a worrying upward trend. Health experts believe international travel and lower vaccination rates in some regions are contributing to the rise.

Globally, measles remains a serious threat. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that measles is one of the most contagious viral diseases, spreading easily through coughing, sneezing, or even breathing the same air as an infected person. It primarily affects children and can lead to complications such as pneumonia, brain swelling, or death. In 2023 alone, over 107 000 people, mostly children under 5, died from measles despite the existence of a reliable vaccine.

There is an outbreak of Hepatitis A in the Algarve and Alentejo, mainly affecting children, warns the DGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Directorate-General for Health (DGS) today [21 Jun 2025] warned of the existence of an outbreak of hepatitis A located in the regions of Algarve, Alentejo and Lisbon and Tagus Valley, with transmission associated with poor health conditions, which has particularly affected children.

In a statement, the DGS warned of the increase in transmission of the hepatitis A virus in the country, where 504 cases of infection were reported between 1 Jan and 31 May 2025.

This situation ""represents an increase in the transmission of the hepatitis A virus in Portugal, in line with the trend reported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on active outbreaks in different European countries"", said the DGS.

Of the total of 504 confirmed cases of acute liver infection, 122 are associated with transmission through sexual contact, distributed across several regions of the country, but with a higher incidence in Lisbon and Vale do Tejo and in the Porto Metropolitan Area, the majority of which are men between 18 and 44 years old.

In addition to this situation, the DGS reported that a 2nd outbreak was identified in the regions of Algarve, Alentejo and Lisbon and Vale do Tejo.

According to the Directorate-General, hepatitis A is often asymptomatic or mild in children under 5 years of age, but in adults it can manifest itself suddenly, with symptoms such as fever, malaise and abdominal pain, with jaundice -- yellowing of the skin and eyes -- being the most characteristic sign.

There is no chronic form of the disease and the infection confers lifelong immunity, the DGS also highlighted, ensuring that health authorities at national and subnational level monitor the situation constantly, adopting appropriate public health measures to contain the spread of the infection.

Among these measures, the DGS highlighted contact tracing and monitoring, pre-exposure vaccination of risk groups and health education actions.

The DGS stated that pre-exposure vaccination against the virus is the main form of prevention, and is especially recommended for people who reside in or travel to endemic areas or areas with active outbreaks, with sexual practices associated with an increased risk of infection and with chronic diseases or other conditions that may aggravate the clinical course of infection by the hepatitis A virus.

The hepatitis A vaccination standard is being reviewed to facilitate free access for the most vulnerable groups of the population. Vaccination is also available on a post-exposure basis, aimed at close contacts of confirmed cases, in accordance with current national guidelines and eligibility criteria, with the aim of preventing the emergence of secondary cases.

In conjunction with civil society organizations and sexual health services, the DGS has been developing information and awareness campaigns, disseminated through its digital platforms and mobile dating applications.

Whooping cough outbreaks declared in Iqaluit, Pond Inlet
--------------------------------------------------------
There is an outbreak of pertussis (whooping cough) in Iqaluit and Pond Inlet, Nunavut, according to the territory's chief public health officer.

The Department of Health announced the outbreaks in a pair of news releases Saturday [21 Jun 2025]. It said anyone can get the respiratory disease -- also known as pertussis -- but that the most severe cases are in children under the age of 1. Although it spreads easily from person to person, the department says it is preventable by getting vaccinated. 

Symptoms of whooping cough include a low fever, a cough that lasts longer than a week or is followed by an unusual ""whoop"" sound, vomiting after coughing and coughing that is worse at night. Anyone with these symptoms is told to stay home, avoid contact with others, and to contact their local health center.

The department said pertussis can spread from the time someone catches it -- before they start coughing -- until 3 weeks after their symptoms have started, or until they have been taking treatment for five days. The respiratory infection can be treated with antibacterials. They have urged people to get vaccinated against the disease, but also to curb the spread with frequent hand washing, coughing into tissues or sleeves, and not sharing food, drinks, utensils or toothbrushes.

Outbreaks of whooping cough that began in Kugaruuk and Naujaat in the spring were declared in May 2025.

Rapid Spread of Whooping Cough: Alert Should Be Raised to Prevent Infection among Infants
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of patients with whooping cough, which is characterized by severe coughing that can last for a prolonged period of time, has surged. Caution must be strengthened, particularly for babies, as they are more prone to developing severe symptoms if they become infected.

Whooping cough is transmitted through cough droplets or contact with hands that are contaminated with a certain type of bacteria. It is significantly more contagious than seasonal influenza and other diseases.

This year [2025], the number of patients has exceeded 28 000 nationwide. The figure has already significantly surpassed the 2019 figure of 16 845, which was the record high in recent years. Moreover, the weekly number of patients in early June [2025] topped 3000, indicating the rapid spread of infection.

The infection is spreading across all age groups, but it is particularly prevalent among children aged 10 or younger.

Caution is especially needed for infants. If babies are infected within the first 6 months after they are born, they are at high risk of losing their lives from developing respiratory distress and pneumonia. At least 2 infants died this year [2025] due to whooping cough.

Those related to such entities as childcare facilities and schools must be vigilant for infection clusters. It is important for people who have symptoms, including adults, to quickly see a doctor to prevent the spread of infection.

Whooping cough caused many deaths until the 1940s, but shortly after World War II, vaccinations began to be administered, allowing those who became infected to only have mild symptoms. However, as the symptoms are mild, people could spread the disease without knowing it.

It is hoped that people who are coughing wear a mask and follow certain etiquette to prevent the spread of infection. It is also crucial to check whether basic measures against infection are taken, such as hand washing.

Infants are eligible to receive vaccinations against whooping cough at public expense. Currently, they are supposed to receive a total of 4 doses at various intervals after they are 2 months old. Parents and guardians are urged to have infants vaccinated as soon as they reach 2 months of age.

It is also effective for family members to voluntarily receive additional vaccinations in order to protect infants. However, there has been a surge in demand for such additional vaccinations, raising concerns in the medical field about a shortage of the vaccines for voluntary shots.

It is hoped that medical institutions will prioritize people who are more in need of the vaccines, such as family members who have close contact with babies.

Treatment usually involves the use of antimicrobial drugs but recently there has been an increase in drug-resistant bacteria that do not respond to antimicrobial drugs. The current outbreak is believed to be linked to the spread of such bacteria. The drug-resistant bacteria have been spreading in countries and regions such as China. There also have been a series of reports of the bacteria in Japan since late last year [2024].

Patients infected with such drug-resistant bacteria require different antimicrobial drugs for treatment. It is hoped that medical associations and other relevant groups will make efforts to make appropriate treatment methods widely known.

Hasta las montaÃ±as de la Sierra Nevada, en lo alto del rÃ­o Tucurinca, llegÃ³ un equipo mÃ©dico interinstitucional para atender de manera urgente un brote de tosferina que afecta a la comunidad indÃ­gena Kogui Kokldaxa Cherua. Esta zona rural, situada en el municipio de CiÃ©naga, es de difÃ­cil acceso debido a su ubicaciÃ³n remota y a las condiciones geogrÃ¡ficas propias de la regiÃ³n montaÃ±osa. Sin embargo, estas dificultades no representaron un impedimento para que las autoridades de salud actuaran con rapidez, demostrando un alto grado de coordinaciÃ³n y compromiso para proteger a esta poblaciÃ³n vulnerable.

La intervenciÃ³n se logrÃ³ gracias a un esfuerzo conjunto entre varias entidades del sector salud, incluyendo la SecretarÃ­a Seccional de Salud del Magdalena, la SecretarÃ­a de Salud de CiÃ©naga, la ESE San CristÃ³bal, la EPS indÃ­gena Dusakawi y la IPS Gonawuidua. AdemÃ¡s, contÃ³ con el apoyo estratÃ©gico de la Fuerza Aeroespacial Colombiana (CACOM-3), que facilitÃ³ el transporte aÃ©reo del personal mÃ©dico y de los insumos necesarios, garantizando asÃ­ la llegada oportuna a esta comunidad apartada. Este trabajo articulado fue clave para enfrentar la emergencia sanitaria con eficacia y prontitud.

Durante la jornada, el equipo mÃ©dico brindÃ³ atenciÃ³n integral a mÃ¡s de 130 personas, entre niÃ±os, adultos y mujeres gestantes, reconociendo la importancia de cubrir todas las etapas de la vida ante un brote de esta naturaleza. Se realizaron acciones fundamentales para el control y la prevenciÃ³n de la tosferina, entre las que destaca la toma de nueve muestras para confirmar casos de la enfermedad. AdemÃ¡s, se tomÃ³ una muestra adicional para investigar una posible InfecciÃ³n Respiratoria Aguda Grave (IRAG), lo que evidencia la exhaustividad del abordaje clÃ­nico en esta intervenciÃ³n.

En paralelo, se suministrÃ³ tratamiento empÃ­rico a 15 pacientes que presentaban sÃ­ntomas compatibles con la tosferina, con el fin de contener la propagaciÃ³n del brote y proteger la salud de los habitantes. Como parte de las medidas preventivas, tambiÃ©n se aplicaron mÃ¡s de 30 vacunas, incluyendo una dosis a una mujer gestante, fortaleciendo los esquemas de inmunizaciÃ³n en esta poblaciÃ³n especialmente vulnerable.

Surto de hepatite A em Portugal com 504 casos
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Tal como outros países europeus, Portugal está a lidar com um surto de hepatite A, com 504 casos notificados neste ano. Daquele total, um quarto inserem-se em contexto de transmissão sexual, com maior incidência em Lisboa e no Porto. Tendo a Direção-Geral da Saúde (DGS) identificado também um outro surto, a Sul do país, entre a população infantil. Estando a autoridade nacional de saúde a implementar ""as medidas de saúde necessárias com vista à prevenção de novos contágios, através do rastreio de contatos, de vacinação e de educação para a saúde"".

O alerta surgiu, nesta semana, pelas mãos do Centro Europeu de Prevenção e Controlo das Doenças (ECDC), no seu mais recente relatório sobre doenças transmissíveis em circulação na Europa, com uma nota específica para Portugal. Recordando o surto iniciado em fevereiro do ano passado, o ECDC dá nota de ""122 casos associados  ao contacto sexual entre homens que fazem sexo com homens (HSH)"" e que ""a maioria dos novos casos foi relatada entre pessoas não vacinadas"".

Questionada pelo JN, nomeadamente sobre quantos casos e se apenas entre HSH, a DGS faz saber que ""em 2025, e até 31 de maio, foram notificados 122 casos confirmados de hepatite A no contexto de transmissão sexual, o que representa um quarto do total de casos de infeção pelo vírus de hepatite A"". De acordo com a autoridade nacional de saúde, ""os casos foram reportados em várias regiões do país, com maior incidência nas regiões de Lisboa e Vale do Tejo e do Norte, nomeadamente no Porto"". Com  preponderância do sexo masculino, entre os 18 e 44 anos de idade.

Posteriormente, em comunicado na tarde desta sexta-feira [20/junho/2025] publicado no seu site na Internet, veio informar da existência de ""um segundo surto localizado nas regiões do Algarve, Alentejo e região de Lisboa e Vale do Tejo, com transmissão associada a condições deficitárias de salubridade, que tem afetado, particularmente, a população infantil"". Não quantificando o número de crianças infetadas com hepatite A.

Sobre o que está a ser feito em termos de saúde pública, na resposta enviada ao JN a DGS adianta que ""as autoridades de saúde têm feito o acompanhamento direto e em permanência da situação, tomando as medidas de saúde necessárias com vista à prevenção de novos contágios, através do rastreio de contatos, de vacinação e de educação para a saúde"". Lembrando que para grupos de risco - pessoas que ""participem em eventos de grande dimensão"", que ""tenham práticas sexuais que as coloquem em risco acrescido para a infeção"" ou que ""viajam para áreas endémicas"" - ""a vacinação pré-exposição contra a hepatite A é a principal medida de prevenção"". Estando, também, ""disponível em regime de pós-exposição para contatos próximos de casos confirmados"".

A vacina, que não está incluída no Plano Nacional de Vacinação, custa entre 17 e 20 euros, sendo gratuita para candidatos a transplante hepático e crianças sob terapêutica com fatores de coagulação derivados do plasma. No comunicado entretanto publicado, a DGS informa estar a ""rever a norma da vacinação contra a hepatite A, com vista a facilitar o acesso gratuito à vacinação para os grupos mais vulneráveis da população"". Ficando por se saber se nesse grupo estão incluídas as crianças.

A decorrer até domingo em Lisboa, o EuroPride, emblemático evento LGBTI+ da Europa, é alvo também de reflexão pelo ECDC, na medida em que ""se espera um grande número de participantes, incluindo internacionais"". Mas também porque, em Portugal, ""há um surto de hepatite A entre HSH e um número crescente de casos foi detectado desde novembro de 2024"", pode ler-se no referido relatório semanal.

Adiantando o ECDC que, ""no contexto de preparação e resposta ao evento, as orientações nacionais foram reforçadas e os stocks de vacinas contra a hepatite A reabastecidos nas unidades de saúde nas áreas próximas aos eventos"". A DGS, por sua vez, sublinha ter ""desenvolvido campanhas através das suas plataformas de comunicação e em aplicações de encontros, com o objetivo de informar sobre os comportamentos de risco"".

Promovendo, assim, ""a vacinação preventiva"" e ""incentivando a procura de cuidados de saúde em casos de sintomas compatíveis com hepatite A"". Campanhas estas que, frisa a autoridade nacional de saúde, ""estão a ser promovidas com especial enfoque na população GBHSH (gays, bissexuais e HSH) no contexto do EuroPride Lisbon 2025.

Whooping cough outbreak in 130 indigenous Koguis
-------------------------------------
An inter-institutional medical team arrived in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada, at the top of the Tucurinca River, to urgently attend to an outbreak of pertussis (whooping cough) affecting the Kogui Kokldaxa Cherua indigenous community. This rural area, located in the municipality of CiÃ©naga, is difficult to access due to its remote location and the geographical conditions of the mountainous region. However, these difficulties did not prevent health authorities from acting quickly, demonstrating a high degree of coordination and commitment to protect this vulnerable population.

The intervention was achieved thanks to a joint effort between several entities in the health sector, including the Magdalena Sectional Health Secretariat, the CiÃ©naga Health Secretariat, the San CristÃ³bal ESE, the Dusakawi Indigenous EPS, and the Gonawuidua IPS. In addition, it had the strategic support of the Colombian Aerospace Force (CACOM-3), which facilitated the air transport of medical personnel and the necessary supplies, thus guaranteeing the timely arrival to this remote community. This articulated work was key to facing the health emergency effectively and promptly.

During the day, the medical team provided comprehensive care to more than 130 people, including children, adults, and pregnant women, recognizing the importance of covering all stages of life in the face of an outbreak of this nature. Fundamental actions were carried out for the control and prevention of pertussis, including the taking of 9 samples to confirm cases of the disease. In addition, an additional sample was taken to investigate a possible severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), which shows the exhaustiveness of the clinical approach in this intervention.

At the same time, prophylactic treatment was provided to 15 patients with symptoms compatible with whooping cough, in order to contain the spread of the outbreak and protect the health of the inhabitants. As part of the preventive measures, more than 30 vaccines were also applied, including one dose to a pregnant woman, strengthening immunization schedules in this especially vulnerable population.

[Editado por Jaime Torres]


El brote de sarampión en México, lo ubican en segundo lugar en la región de las Américas al tener el mayor número de casos confirmados, solo por debajo de Canadá al sumar 2 mil 597 casos en todo el país, en 18 estados y 58 municipios; en los últimos tres días el reporte de nuevos pacientes subió a 90 con la mayor tasa de incidencia en el Estado de Chihuahua, según ha comunicado la Secretaría de Salud.

En esta entidad los 47 casos confirmados han sido en una comunidad menonita en donde murieron dos niños por complicaciones derivadas del virus, uno tenía 7 años y otro un bebé de 11 mes, ninguno de los dos estaba vacunados pese a las campañas masivas de vacunación dirigidas a la población para frenar la ola de contagios.

La causa de muerte de los niños fue por complicaciones derivada de una neumonía, uno de ellos padecía de leucemia y el otro una afección renal que agravó el cuadro clínico, la madre de los niños fallecidos tampoco estaba vacunada por lo que no pudo transmitir inmunidad a los infantes originarios de las comunidades de Namiquipa y Ojinaga.

Los casos confirmados de sarampión afectan a ambos sexos, 47 por ciento a hombres y 53 por ciento a mujeres, siendo el principal grupo de edad afectado de los 0 a 4 años donde existen 520 casos, seguido de 25 a 29 años donde en este grupo de edad existen 386 casos y en edades de los 30 a 34 años 320 casos

Otras entidades que reportan contagios son Sonora con 73 casos, Michoacán y Durango con 13 casos, respectivamente; Tamaulipas con 12 casos y Coahuila con 11casos; el primer caso de muerte por sarampión detectado en el país fue en el estado de Chihuahua el pasado mes de abril, en un hombre de 31 años que no estaba vacunado y tenía problemas renales previos al contagio, además de diabetes que agravaron su estado de salud al contraer el sarampión.

La segunda muerte confirmada por la Secretaría de Salud fue en el estado de Sonora en una niña de un año de edad, hija de padres jornaleros agrícolas provenientes del estado de Chihuahua que trabajaban en los campos agrícolas de Cajeme, quien presentaba un cuadro de desnutrición severa, no había sido vacunada y no fue llevada por los padres a recibir atención médica en algún centro de salud y falleció en el domicilio de residencia temporal donde se encontraban.

De acuerdo a información de grupo fórmula el principal factor de riesgo para contraer la enfermedad es la falta de vacunación, lo que ha llevado a las autoridades sanitarias a volcar los esfuerzos en una campaña de vacunación masiva, en Sonora al ser e segundo estado con mayor incidencia en contagios con 30 casos confirmados y 94 probables, hay desplegados escuadrones que realizan cercos sanitarios y vacunación focalizada, con el objetivo de mantener la enfermedad confinada al lugar de residencia temporal de los casos.

Chihuahua, por su lado, ya lleva más de 130 mil personas vacunadas y está previsto que se apliquen 18 mil dosis más a habitantes de menos de 39 años, según ha informado la gobernadora Maru Campos. “Si no te acuerdas si tienes la vacuna, no te preocupes, también podemos vacunarte”, insistió en sus redes sociales.

La ola de contagios comenzó en Texas, Estados Unidos, en el mes de enero, a finales de febrero las autoridades registraron la primera muerte producida por el que es ya el mayor brote de sarampión que ha vivido en los últimos 30 años, se trataba de un niño en edad escolar que había sido internado en el hospital pediátrico del condado de Gaines, una población menonita donde las tasas de vacunación están muy por debajo de los objetivos nacionales.

La mayor incidencia de los casos de contagio de sarampión se han concentrado en esa localidad de Estados Unidos en niños en edad escolar no vacunados, muchos de ellos fueron hospitalizados y algunos requirieron cuidados intensivos, el brote se extendió a otros estados como Nueva Jersey donde se investiga una exposición masiva en un concierto de Shakira y de ahí pudo haber traspasado la frontera de México y causar estragos en la población, según afirma el Departamento de Salud de Estados Unidos.

Hepatitis A outbreak infects thousands of travelers at popular destinations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Over 2000 cases and several deaths reported across 4 European countries

A spike in viral infections has sickened thousands of travelers and caused several deaths at some popular European destinations.

Four countries -- Austria, Czechia, Hungary and Slovakia -- have reported a spike in hepatitis A cases between January and May 2025, according to a rapid risk assessment issued by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

In total, 2097 cases have been reported across the 4 countries. 

Slovakia, which has been dealing with an active outbreak since 2022, represents 880 of those cases. Czechia is the next most affected country, reporting 600 cases and 6 deaths, the ECDC stated. Hungary has reported 530 cases in 2025, and Austria has reported 87.

Hepatitis A is an ""acute viral liver disease"" caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV), according to the agency. 

The disease is mainly spread through contaminated food or water, or through close contact with infected people. 

Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst, said that hepatitis A is a ""widely transmissible"" disease that spreads easily among food handlers and ""can get you very sick.""

People who have not received the hepatitis A vaccination or been infected by the virus are susceptible, the agency noted. Vaccinations are given in 2 doses, 6 to 12 months apart, according to Siegel.

""People will have lifetime immunity after infection,"" the doctor noted. ""A doctor can check your titres (levels of blood antibodies) to document that you are immune from prior vaccination.""

Groups most affected by the infections include people who are homeless, use or inject recreational drugs or live in unsanitary conditions, as well as those with limited access to healthcare.

""Within these groups, the risk of the disease is assessed as moderate for those below 40 years of age and high for adults 40 years of age or older, as the severity of the disease increases with age,"" the ECDC stated. 

""For people with predisposing liver disease or older adults, the risk can be very high. The risk for the broader population in these countries is assessed as low to moderate.""

Those who are immunosuppressed are also at a higher risk, the alert said.

Not everyone will develop symptoms, but those who do may notice the following common effects, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
- Dark urine or clay-colored stools
- Diarrhea
- Fatigue
- Fever
- Joint pain
- Loss of appetite
- Nausea, stomach pain or vomiting
- Yellow skin or eyes (jaundice)

""This outbreak reminds us that hepatitis A can cause serious illness and death, especially among people with limited access to healthcare and basic hygiene,"" said Ole Heuer, head of the ECDC's One Health Unit, in a press release. 

""We need to strengthen outreach, provide access to vaccination in groups more likely to be exposed and ensure basic sanitation, especially in response to the increase in cases.""

To address the outbreak, the ECDC recommends investigating potential means of transmission of hepatitis A, such as ""possible foodborne transmission or spill-overs into other groups at increased risk of infection.""

The agency also calls for targeted vaccination programs, ""post-exposure prophylaxis"" to close contacts to prevent infection, and more genetic testing of the virus, as well as increased education and awareness among high-risk groups.

According to the CDC, receiving the hepatitis A vaccine or immune globulin (medication containing antibodies) within 2 weeks of exposure can prevent illness.

There have been 1214 confirmed measles cases this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday [20 Jun 2025]. Health officials in Texas, where the nation's biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed 6 cases in the last week.

There are 3 other major outbreaks in North America. The longest, in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 2179 cases from mid-October [2024] through 17 Jun 2024. The province logged its 1st death 5 Jun 2025 in a baby who got congenital measles but also had other preexisting conditions.

Another outbreak in Alberta, Canada, has sickened 996 as of Thursday [19 Jun 2025]. And the Mexican state of Chihuahua had 2335 measles cases and 4 deaths as of Friday [20 Jun 2025], according to data from the state health ministry.

Other U.S. states with active outbreaks -- which the CDC defines as 3 or more related cases -- include Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota and Oklahoma.

In the U.S., 2 elementary school-aged children in the epicenter in West Texas and an adult in New Mexico have died of measles this year [2025]. All were unvaccinated.

Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that's airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.

How many measles cases are there in Texas?
------------------------------------------
There are a total of 750 cases across 35 counties, most of them in West Texas, state health officials said Tuesday [17 Jun 2025].

Throughout the outbreak, 97 people have been hospitalized.

State health officials estimated less than 1% of cases -- fewer than 10 -- are actively infectious. Fifty-five percent of Texas' cases are in Gaines County, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 413 cases since late January [2025] -- just under 2% of its residents.

The 3 Apr 2025 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Local health officials said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of ""what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure."" An unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February [2025]; Kennedy said the child was 6.

How many measles cases are there in New Mexico?
-----------------------------------------------
New Mexico held steady Friday [20 Jun 2025] with a total of 81 cases.

Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state's cases are in Lea County. Sandoval County near Albuquerque has 6 cases, Eddy County has 3, Doña Ana County has 2. Chaves, Curry and San Juan counties have one each.

An unvaccinated adult died of measles-related illness 6 Mar 2025. The person did not seek medical care.

How many cases are there in Oklahoma?
-------------------------------------
Oklahoma added one case Friday [20 Jun 2025] for a total of 17 confirmed and 3 probable cases.

The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases.

How many cases are there in Arizona?
------------------------------------
Arizona has 4 cases in Navajo County. They are linked to a single source, the county health department said 9 Jun 2025. All 4 were unvaccinated and had a history of recent international travel.

How many cases are there in Colorado?
------------------------------------
Colorado has seen a total of 16 measles cases in 2025, which includes one outbreak of 10 related cases.

The outbreak is linked to a Turkish Airlines flight that landed at Denver International Airport in mid-May [2025]. Four of the people were on the flight with the 1st case -- an out-of-state traveler not included in the state count -- while 5 got measles from exposure in the airport and one elsewhere.

Health officials are also tracking an unrelated case in a Boulder County resident. The person was fully vaccinated but had ""recently traveled to Europe, where there are a large number of measles cases,"" the state health department said.

Other counties that have seen measles this year [2025] include Archuleta and Pueblo.

How many cases are there in Georgia?
------------------------------------
Georgia has an outbreak of 3 cases in metro Atlanta, with the most recent infection confirmed Wednesday [18 Jun 2025].

The state has confirmed 6 total cases in 2025. The remaining 3 are part of an unrelated outbreak from January.

How many cases are there in Illinois?
-------------------------------------
Illinois health officials confirmed a 4-case outbreak on 5 May 2025 in the far southern part of the state. It grew to 8 cases as of 6 Jun 2025, but no new cases were reported in the following weeks, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.

The state's other 2 cases so far this year [2025] were in Cook County, and are unrelated to the southern Illinois outbreak.

How many cases are there in Iowa?
---------------------------------
Iowa has had 6 total measles cases in 2025.

Four are part of an outbreak in eastern Johnson County, among members of the same household. County health officials said the people are isolating at home, so they don't expect additional spread.

How many cases are there in Kansas?
-----------------------------------
Kansas has a total of 79 cases across 11 counties in the southwestern part of the state, with 3 hospitalizations. All but 3 of the cases are connected, and most are in Gray County.

How many cases are there in Montana?
------------------------------------
Montana had 22 measles cases as of Friday [20 Jun 2025]. Fourteen were in Gallatin County, which is where the 1st cases showed up -- Montana's 1st in 35 years.

Flathead and Yellowstone counties had 2 cases each, and Hill County had 4 cases.

There are outbreaks in neighboring North Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.

How many cases are there in North Dakota?
-----------------------------------------
North Dakota, which hadn't seen measles since 2011, was up to 34 cases as of 6 Jun 2025, but has held steady since. Two of the people have been hospitalized. All of the people with confirmed cases were not vaccinated.

There were 16 cases in Williams County in western North Dakota on the Montana border. On the eastern side of the state, there were 10 cases in Grand Forks County and 7 cases in Cass County. Burke County, in northwest North Dakota on the border of Saskatchewan, Canada, had one case.

Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.?
---------------------------------------------
Measles cases also have been reported this year [2025] in Alaska, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

Health officials declared earlier outbreaks in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania over after 6 weeks of no new cases. Tennessee's outbreak also appears to be over.

Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. The CDC said in May [2025] that more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the U.S. compared to May of last year [2024]. Most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.

What do you need to know about the MMR vaccine?
-----------------------------------------------
The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The 1st shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the 2nd between 4 and 6 years old.

Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don't need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from ""killed"" virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.

People who have documentation that they had measles are immune and those born before 1957 generally don't need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have ""presumptive immunity.""

Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates -- above 95% -- due to ""herd immunity."" But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.

What are the symptoms of measles?
---------------------------------
Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.

The rash generally appears 3 to 5 days after the 1st symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit [40 deg C], according to the CDC.

Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.

How can you treat measles?
--------------------------
There's no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.

---------------------------------------------------------

Diphtheria is caused by toxigenic _Corynebacterium_ spp. producing the major pathogenicity factor diphtheria toxin (DT). DT is encoded on the tox gene and causes local respiratory or cutaneous symptoms, as well as systemic neurologic and cardiologic symptoms. The 3 potentially DT-producing species are the mainly human pathogen _C. diphtheriae_ and the 2 zoonotic pathogens _C. ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_. In recent years, the _C. diphtheriae_ species complex (CdSC) was expanded, mostly on the basis of genomic data, in some instances supported by biochemical properties (1). Two closely related species were separated from _C. diphtheriae_ (i.e., _C. belfantii_ [2] and _C. rouxii_ [3]), and 2 were separated from _C. ulcerans_ (i.e., _C. silvaticum_ [4] and _C. ramonii_ [5], previously known as lineage 2 of _C. ulcerans_).

_C. silvaticum_ (formerly _C. ulcerans_ wildlife cluster), was recently described as a novel zoonotic species causing caseous lymphadenitis in 33 wild boars and a roe deer in Germany (4,6). Subsequently, _C. silvaticum_ was identified in a wild boar from Germany (7) and in a domestic pig from Portugal (8). So far, all animal isolates from Germany were nontoxigenic tox-bearing (NTTB) (4,8,9), whereas isolates from Portugal and Austria were found to be either NTTB or tox-positive, resulting in 2 recently postulated clades depending on molecular characteristics of the tox gene (10). Although _C. silvaticum_ is considered a zoonotic pathogen with the potential to infect humans, no human infections had been described. In this study, we report 2 cases of human _C. silvaticum_ infection.

The study
---------
In case 1, a 37-year-old male butcher sought care for an indolent tumor in the lateral thorax and the right axilla that had been present for 3 weeks. A bacterial swab specimen taken during surgical extirpation grew _Corynebacterium_ sp. after 48 hours in pure culture; the pathogen was _C. ulcerans_ by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Bruker, <https://www.bruker.com>). The strain was sent to the German Consiliary Laboratory for Diphtheria (Oberschleibheim, Germany) for further analysis. The strain (KL1848) showed an atypical colony morphology (small waxy white, discrete ß-hemolytic colonies after 48 hours' incubation) and biochemical reactions: fermentation of glucose, ribose, and maltose (like _C. ulcerans_), but no use of D-xylose, mannitol, lactose, sucrose, or glycogen (like _C. pseudotuberculosis_). It was sensitive to clindamycin, according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing guidelines for _C. diphtheriae_ and _C. ulcerans_ (<https://www.eucast.org/clinical_breakpoints>). The isolate was identified as a NTTB _C. silvaticum_ strain using previously described methods (11) (i.e., tox-PCR, an optimized Elek test, a lateral flow immunoassay, and whole-genome sequencing [WGS] analyses) (Appendix 1). The patient was successfully treated with surgery and cefuroxime for 14 days. The patient reported to have recently field-dressed a hunted wild boar that showed suspicious mesenterial lymph nodes. The patient's immunization status was unknown. No secondary human cases occurred.

In case 2, a 21-year-old man sought care for an indolent axillary tumor that had been present for 4 weeks. Lymphoma was suspected on the basis of computed tomography results. The affected lymph node was removed, revealing a fibrosed soft tissue with florid purulent abscess formation and chronic granulating histiocyte-rich granulomatous inflammation. After a few days of incubation, the tissue sample grew a pure culture of _Corynebacterium_ sp., identified as _C. ulcerans_ by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Bruker). The strain (KL1281) was sent to the German Consiliary Laboratory for Diphtheria. The atypical colony morphology, biochemical reactions, and antimicrobial susceptibility were identical to those of strain KL1848. We identified the isolate as NTTB _C. silvaticum_ using the same methods as in case 1. The case 2 patient had a dog and lived in a rural area of northern Germany. He reported no contact with wild animals. Vaccination against diphtheria was completed. No secondary human case was observed.

Average nucleotide identity analysis of WGS assemblies compared with public type-strain genomes of the CdSC classified both isolates with highest concordance as _C. silvaticum_ with identity values >99.9%. Identity values for the other species were nearly identical for both strains and clearly below the species threshold of 94%-96% (12); values were 90.6% for _C. ramonii_ FRC0011T, 90.5% for _C. ulcerans_ NCTC7910T, 85.0% for _C. pseudotuberculosis_ ATCC19410T, 74.3% for _C. diphtheriae_ NCTC11397T, 74.1% for _C. rouxii_ FRC190T, and 74.0% for _C. belfantii_ FRC0043T.

We constructed gene phylogenies of 16S and rpoB from the WGS data and compared them with the respective genes of the CdSC-type strains and _C. kutscheri_ as an outgroup. The phylogenetic trees (Figure 1 [for figures/tables, for original URL - Mod.LL]) show a clear assignment to _C. silvaticum_ because both isolates share the branch of the _C. silvaticum_-type strain with clear separation from the other species. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis with the _C. diphtheriae_ scheme showed sequence type (ST) 578, exclusive to _C. silvaticum_ and typically also found in isolates from wild boar and roe deer in Germany (Appendix 2). Evaluation of the tox gene and an alignment with tox sequences from Germany, published sequences from Portugal (10), and a _C. diphtheriae_ tox sequence as reference revealed the presence of the insertion of 2 guanine residues after position 44 (Appendix 1 Figure), as found in the other Germany isolates from wild boar and roe deer, enabling assignment to _C. silvaticum_ clade 2 (10).

To investigate the clade classification with a more detailed core genome MLST analysis, we constructed an ad hoc core genome MLST scheme on the basis of publicly available _C. silvaticum_ genomes from both clades (Appendix 1). We generated a minimum-spanning tree from 45 genomes, consisting of KL1281, KL1848, an additional 35 isolates from animals from Germany, and the 8 clade 1 genomes from Portugal (10). The tree layout (Figure 2) and the allelic distances (Appendix 1) clearly affiliate the patient cases with the cases from clade 2 from Germany, whereas the genomes from clade 1 from Portugal sit on another branch and show >500 allelic differences to clade 2. Thus, the classification by the tox gene is also supported by a whole-genome context.

Conclusions
-----------
_C. silvaticum_ (4) has been suspected to be a possible zoonotic member of the newly expanded CdSC. Originally isolated from forest-associated animals such as wild boars and roe deer, it has also been identified in a domestic pig. In this study, we report 2 cases of human infection linked to close animal contact (wild boar and dog). In case 1, the most probable route of infection was direct contact with infectious tissue and possible microtrauma lesions during a slaughtering or animal field-dressing procedure. In case 2, no close contact to wild animals was reported, although the patient lived in a rural area and owned a dog. However, _C. silvaticum_ has so far been only identified in wild forest-dwelling animals and a pig. All cases in Germany, including the 2 human cases described in this study, were found to be NTTB and summarized in a corresponding NTTB clade with a 2-bp insertion in the tox gene sequence, named clade 2 (10). In contrast, in Portugal and Austria, another monophyletic clade of DT-producing _C. silvaticum_ was reported and named clade 1 (10).

In conclusion, _C. silvaticum_ should be considered a zoonotic pathogen with possible animal-to-human transmission. Therefore, animal sources, especially wild boar and domestic pigs, should be included when tracing sources of potentially toxigenic _Corynebacterium_ spp. of the broader _C. diphtheriae_ and the narrower _C. ulcerans_ complex. _C. ulcerans_ has also been transmitted from pigs to humans (13,14). With respect to the known clindamycin resistance in _C. ulcerans_ (15), antimicrobial susceptibility testing should support antibiotic therapy. Suitable precaution measures should be taken when handling wild boars and pigs to avoid zoonotic risk for _C. ulcerans_ or _C. silvaticum_ infection.

Long considered a disease of the past, brought under control through vaccination, diphtheria is resurfacing with concern in several regions of the world, particularly in Europe.

Morocco is no exception to this alarming trend. For several months, pediatricians from various hospitals have been warning of an increase in cases. So far, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection has not officially communicated on the subject.

Our sources link this resurgence to a general decline in vaccination coverage in the country. It should be remembered that this decline first caused a massive resurgence of measles, with nearly 25 000 suspected cases and more than 100 deaths since September 2023.

While the situation has been brought under control thanks to government efforts, it is clear that the problem is not limited to measles: other preventable diseases, such as diphtheria, are once again threatening.

According to Dr. Saïd Afif, president of the Moroccan Association of Health Sciences, measles cases have decreased by 15% compared to last week, an encouraging sign of improvement. However, while health authorities, supported by the relevant ministries, are taking coordinated action to contain the epidemic, public mistrust, exacerbated by misinformation, represents another challenge that is not yet over.

Contacted by ""Le Matin"", Dr. Tayeb Hamdi, a medical researcher in health policies and systems, emphasizes the seriousness of the disease. ""Diphtheria is a bacterial infection caused by a bacterium that secretes an extremely dangerous toxin, capable of causing severe lesions, particularly to the heart and nervous system, with sometimes fatal complications,"" he explains.

""Although the disease mainly affects children, it can affect all age groups,"" he specifies. Asked about the warning signs, Dr. Hamdi cites a painful sore throat accompanied by a greyish membrane covering the throat and tonsils, associated with fever, sore throat and hoarseness.

What particularly worries specialists today is the characteristic swelling of the neck, called ""hoof neck."" ""Beyond local symptoms, the bacterial toxin can circulate in the blood and cause serious complications such as myocarditis, paralysis, or respiratory failure,"" he explains. 

""Without prompt treatment, these complications can be fatal,"" he warns, calling for increased vigilance in the face of any clinical changes. Dr. Hamdi also points out that diphtheria is primarily transmitted through the air, via respiratory droplets emitted by an infected person. 

""It can also spread through direct contact with skin lesions, in the case of cutaneous diphtheria,"" he adds. For Dr. Hamdi, vaccination remains the only effective means of protection against diphtheria.

""Thanks to high vaccination coverage, Morocco has not recorded any significant cases of diphtheria for several years. But the situation is currently deteriorating, hence the urgency to act,"" he warns.

He emphasizes the need to strengthen catch-up vaccination campaigns to fill gaps and ensure sufficient coverage. ""It is also essential to reactivate awareness among the population and health professionals about the importance of vaccination and early diagnosis,"" he adds.

The doctor calls for facilitating and making equitable access to vaccines, particularly in rural and isolated areas, often the most vulnerable. Finally, he emphasizes the importance of rigorous epidemiological surveillance to quickly detect any new cases and intervene effectively.

Utah confirms 3 measles cases amid growing national outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------
The Utah Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has confirmed 3 cases of measles in the state as part of a growing national outbreak. Health officials are urging residents to be vigilant, monitor for symptoms, and ensure they are up-to-date on their measles vaccinations.

Two confirmed exposure locations have been identified in Orem, according to the state website.
- Parkway Health Center, 145 W 1300 S, on 13 Jun 2025 between 12:30 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.
- Timpanogos Regional ER, 750 W 800 N, on 14 Jun 2025 between 2:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.

Anyone who was at these locations during the specified times is advised to monitor for measles-like symptoms -- including high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and rash -- and to complete a risk assessment survey provided by DHHS available here [<https://www.airnow.gov/wildfires/when-smoke-is-in-the-air/#map?utm_source=townlift.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Townlift>] in English and Spanish.

As of 24 Jun 2025 there have been a total of 1227 confirmed measles cases were reported by 37 states nation-wide. 66% of those cases are in people under the age of 19, 95% of whom are unvaccinated.

Recent Travel-Linked Cases
--------------------------
The first reported case in Utah was a traveler passing through the state on 23 May 2025. All individuals potentially exposed during that time have since been notified. A 2nd infected traveler was in southwestern Utah on 26 and 27 May 2025, visiting public places while contagious. Local and state health officials are continuing efforts to notify and monitor individuals who may have been exposed.

Though community spread from these cases has not been confirmed, DHHS warns that more measles cases tied to national travel are likely, and Utah will continue to update the public if further exposures occur.

Vaccination Guidance
--------------------
While Utah is not currently considered a high-risk area for widespread measles transmission, health officials are reinforcing the importance of the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella):
- Infants (6-11 months): Should receive an early dose of MMR if traveling internationally or to outbreak areas within the U.S. These children will still need 2 additional doses at the usual ages (12-15 months and 4-6 years).
- Children over 1 year: Should have at least one dose of the MMR vaccine. The 2nd dose can be given earlier than age 4 if desired, but it's not currently recommended unless the child is traveling to a high-risk area.
- Adults born after 1957: Should have 2 doses of MMR unless medically exempt.
- Those vaccinated between 1963 and 1967: Should be re-vaccinated, as the earlier version of the measles vaccine from that period is no longer considered effective.

""We recommend everyone make sure you are protected against measles,"" DHHS stated, noting that even one dose of MMR provides strong protection.

When to Seek Care
-----------------
If symptoms appear, health officials ask residents to avoid contact with others and call a healthcare provider before visiting in person to prevent further spread.

An outbreak of measles has been detected at a detention center in New Mexico after 5 detainees tested positive for the disease, according to health officials.

The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) reported the outbreak on Thursday [26 Jun 2025] at the Luna County Detention Center in Deming, a city in the southwestern part of the state near the U.S.-Mexico border.

The facility houses approximately 400 detainees and employs about 100 staff members. NMDOH is providing personal protective equipment, test kits, and vaccines, and is checking the vaccination status of all inmates and staff.

""The cases at Luna County Detention Center are a stark reminder that the measles outbreak in New Mexico is not over,"" said Dr. Chad Smelser, a medical epidemiologist at NMDOH. ""We urge everyone in New Mexico, especially Luna County residents, to ensure that they are fully vaccinated against measles.""

New Mexico has reported 86 confirmed measles cases this year [2025], the majority of which -- 67 -- have occurred in Lea County, where 1 of the 3 measles-related deaths this year was reported. The other 2 deaths involved school-aged children in West Texas, the epicenter of a large outbreak that began earlier this year.

Nationwide, 1227 measles cases have been confirmed as of Tuesday [24 Jun 2025], with nearly 800 reported in Texas alone, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can lead to severe health complications in unvaccinated individuals. The virus spreads through airborne droplets when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes, and can linger in the air for up to 2 hours. Early symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes, followed by a widespread rash.

During outbreaks, about 1 in 5 infected individuals requires hospitalization, according to health officials. Serious complications can include pneumonia, brain swelling, and, in rare cases, death.

Measles cases in California surpass 2024 total amid U.S. outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------------
California has already reported more measles cases this year [2025] than in all of 2024, a worrisome development that comes as the nation is suffering its largest outbreak of the super-infectious disease in decades.

The extent of the national outbreak has rocketed measles from a back-of-mind issue -- one rarely, if ever, encountered by a whole generation of Americans -- to a pressing public health concern.

""Measles is completely preventable,"" Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional chief of infectious diseases at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, told The Times.

The virus is spreading almost universally among people who either haven't been vaccinated or whose vaccination status is not known, authorities note. But the MMR shots, so named because they also afford protection against mumps and rubella, has long been in the crosshairs of anti-vaccine activists and skeptics -- some of whom are now in charge of shaping U.S. policy regarding childhood immunizations.

There have been 17 cases of measles reported so far this year [2025] among California residents, up from the 15 reported all of last year [2024], according to the state Department of Public Health. Doctors have been increasingly on alert for measles, which for decades has been so rare that many physicians haven't encountered a single case.

Because of that recent rarity, many may be unfamiliar with how readily measles can spread -- or the serious symptoms it can cause.

""This is not just a mild childhood disease,"" Dr. Erica Pan, director of the California Department of Public Health and state public health officer, said in a recent briefing to doctors.

Measles has a death rate of 1 for every 500 to 1000 cases, Pan said. Nationwide, more than 145 people have been hospitalized with measles so far this year [2025], federal data show, and many of those hospitalized have needed intensive care.

""This can cause very severe disease -- often causes a viral pneumonia that is severe enough to need intensive care,"" Pan said.

Measles is one of the most contagious viruses known to science. It is so infectious you can catch it just by being in a room where an infected person has been -- even up to 2 hours after they left, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The uptick in confirmed measles cases in California, while still somewhat concerning for local public health officials, pales compared with the significant outbreak that began in Texas earlier this year [2025] and has since spread to surrounding states.

Texas has reported at least 750 measles cases; New Mexico, 81; Kansas, 80; North Dakota, 28; and Montana, 23, according to the respective states' health departments. Michigan has reported 15 cases; Ohio and Illinois, 10, and Arkansas and Indiana, 8.

The overwhelming majority of the measles cases are associated with outbreaks tied to close-knit communities with low rates of vaccination, according to the CDC. Recent outbreaks have occurred in areas with a notable population of certain Mennonite Christian communities, starting last fall in Ontario, Canada, which was linked to a large gathering in New Brunswick; then in Texas and New Mexico in late January [2025]; and more recently in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, according to the Associated Press.

The AP reported that officials in Mexico and the U.S. say the outbreaks in their countries match the strain found in Canada.

The CDC says that 95% of this year's [2025] measles cases in the U.S. occurred among people who were either unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. About 29% of cases occurred in children younger than 5, with an additional 37% in those age 5 to 19.

In all, the U.S. has reported 1227 confirmed measles cases so far this year [2025]. That's already rivaling the highest single-year total seen this century -- 1274 were reported in 2019.

You would have to look back a generation to find a higher total than that: 2126 cases were reported nationwide in 1992.

""And those are probably an underreporting,"" Pan said of this year's [2025] case count. Doctors, she said, have learned that most people affected by the measles outbreaks are reluctant to get themselves or their children tested.

Three measles deaths have been reported so far this year [2025], according to the CDC. Two were Texas school-aged children -- both of whom were unvaccinated and had no known underlying health conditions, according to state health officials. The other was an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico who didn't seek medical care before dying, according to health authorities there.

One death has been reported in Mexico, according to the World Health Organization. That person was also unvaccinated. More than 3300 confirmed and suspected measles cases have also been reported in Canada so far this year [2025].

One infant, who was infected with measles before being born premature, died in Canada earlier this month [June 2025], according to Dr. Kieran Moore, the chief medical officer for the province of Ontario. The infant's mother was not vaccinated.

The infant faced other serious medical complications unrelated to the virus, but measles ""may have been a contributing factor in both the premature birth and death,"" Moore said in a statement.

This year [2025] marks the 1st time a child has died from measles in the United States since 2003 -- and the child in that case had a rare genetic condition that impaired the immune system. It's also the 1st time since the 1990s that more than 2 people have died from measles in the U.S. in a single year.

While most associated with its telltale rash, health officials warn that measles can cause symptoms that cross the boundary from discomfort to danger. Measles can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. And years after contracting measles, people can later develop subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or SSPE, a rare but fatal complication resulting from a weakened form of the virus remaining in the body, and later infecting the brain.

""This is a really, really unusual time to see this many deaths -- and seeing previously healthy children with a vaccine-preventable death in the United States,"" Pan said.

Measles can also cause something called ""immune amnesia."" ""It can actually suppress people's immune systems for a few years after having that measles infection,"" Pan said.

The measles outbreaks in Texas, Kansas and New Mexico are so severe that state health officials are recommending early vaccination in babies as young as 6 months in the hardest-hit counties. Those officials are also recommending a 2nd dose for many children earlier than the typical schedule.

The standard CDC recommendation is that children receive the 1st of 2 measles vaccine shots when they turn 1, unless they are traveling internationally, in which case they can get vaccinated at 6 months old.

In California, there is no active measles outbreak, so there's no recommendation for additional or accelerated vaccine doses, Pan said. Most of California's measles cases this year [2025] have involved people who traveled internationally.

Helping matters is California's relatively high vaccination rate among kindergartners. For the 2023-24 school year, 96.2% of California's kindergartners were vaccinated against measles, according to the CDC -- one of the higher rates of any state.

The latest figure is down slightly from the 96.5% seen the year earlier [2024], but it remains above the levels seen prior to 2014-15, when a severe measles outbreak linked to Disneyland prompted state legislators to strengthen vaccination requirements for children who attend school.

Experts aim for a 95% vaccination rate for measles to guard against outbreaks.

Today, California's measles case rate remains much lower than the national rate. But that doesn't mean the state is invulnerable.

There are settings in which unvaccinated people can cluster together, such as group outings of children who are homeschooled.

Another vulnerable setting can be doctor's offices. In 2008, an unvaccinated 7-year-old boy returned home to San Diego from a trip to Switzerland, became sick, then went to school and was taken to the pediatrician. Investigators found that measles then spread to 11 other children who were either unvaccinated or too young to be vaccinated -- 5 in his school, 4 who were in the pediatrician's office at the same time he was, and both of his siblings.

Among those infected were 3 infants younger than 1, one of whom was hospitalized for 2 days, according to a report published by the CDC. Another infant traveled by plane to Hawaii while infectious.

Some California counties also have measles vaccination rates for kindergartners that are below the 95% goal. For the 2023-24 school year, San Diego County's rate is 94.8%; San Bernardino County's is 93.5%; Santa Cruz County's is 91.8%; and Kern County's is 90.7%.

In 2017, a measles outbreak in Los Angeles County was centered in an Orthodox Jewish community, with a number of patients living in Westside L.A., the Santa Monica Mountains and the San Fernando Valley. In early 2019, California's biggest measles outbreak was in Butte County, and started after a man visited the Philippines, a country that was then in the midst of a massive outbreak.

The last time measles caused scores of deaths nationwide was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Between 1989 to 1991, there were about 55 000 cases and more than 130 suspected measles-associated deaths, according to the CDC.

In California, that epidemic was the worst between 1988 and 1991 -- with 18 000 cases, 3500 hospital admissions and 70 deaths reported, according to state health officials. A big problem officials identified at that time was that poor parents could not afford vaccinations for their children. One of the nation's largest outbreaks in 1989 involved mostly preschool-aged children in Los Angeles.

In light of the outbreak, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended a 2nd dose of the measles vaccine be given between the ages of 4 and 6. And in the early 1990s, the federal government created the Vaccines for Children program, which funds a number of vaccinations for children with low-income parents. In 2000, officials declared that measles was no longer being continuously transmitted locally in the U.S., and new cases were only found when someone was infected abroad.

L.A. County has recorded 4 cases of measles so far this year [2025] among residents, up from one all of last year [2024]. Most of the cases this year were associated with someone who either traveled internationally or to domestic areas suffering community transmission of measles, according to the local Department of Public Health.

There were also 2 reported cases among non-county residents this year [2025], including an infant traveling through Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from South Korea who was returning home to Orange County.

In 2024, there were 6 non-L.A. County residents who had measles while traveling through L.A. County; 4 had traveled through Los Angeles International Airport while infectious.

""With measles cases rising across the country and globally, it's important for unprotected individuals to consider preventive measures. Immunization provides the best protection. Additionally, anyone who was exposed should monitor for symptoms,"" the Orange County Health Care Agency said in a statement to The Times.

Symptoms include fever, rash, cough and red, watery eyes. People can be contagious from about 4 days before the rash begins through 4 days afterward.

Those suspecting they have measles should call their medical provider before they go to the doctor's office to avoid potentially exposing other patients, the Health Care Agency said.

The rash traditionally starts at the hairline and moves its way down the body, according to Pan.

Kaiser has seen one case of measles this past month, which was in the Santa Clarita area, Hudson said. Health officials said people were possibly exposed to the contagious individual at a Costco, Trader Joe's and Walmart on the afternoon of 29 May 2025.

""The MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, has an excellent safety record. Hundreds of millions of children have safely received the vaccine worldwide,"" she said in a statement to The Times.

UPDATE: Measles outbreak declared in Grand Traverse County
----------------------------------------------------------
Grand Traverse County is now considered a measles outbreak area, according to the county health department.

There are now at least 3 confirmed cases in the county after the 1st since 2019 was confirmed only last week.

Mike Lahey, the health officer at Grand Traverse County Health Department, said anyone who has not received a vaccine against the disease is at risk, especially children.

""There are age ranges in which those may not be vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella just yet,"" Lahey said. ""There has been a great deal of interest from those parents of infants in our community asking, what can they do to protect their child?""

Measles symptoms include high fevers, open sores and other health issues. In rare cases it can be fatal.

Those who have symptoms or need a vaccine should reach out to their health care provider or local health department.

""Measles can live in the air in aerosolized droplets up to 2 hours after an infected person has left the room,"" Lahey said. ""Therefore it is a great time too for folks to just become educated about their own immunization.""

From 18 Jun 2025: Health officials confirmed measles has made its way to Grand Traverse County after a resident picked up the highly contagious diseases while traveling. It's the 1st positive case in the county since 2019.

The person was diagnosed at Munson Medical Center, according to the Grand Traverse County Health Department. Officials reached out to those who may have been directly or indirectly exposed. At this time, there are no known public exposures related to the case.

Experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say measles is ""so contagious that if one person has it, 9 out of 10 people of all ages around him or her will also become infected if they are not protected.""

The disease causes high fevers and open sores, and it can lead to other health issues like pneumonia, blindness and brain swelling. Symptoms of measles usually begin 7-14 days after exposure, but can appear up to 21 days after exposure.

Vaccines mean it's also a completely preventable disease. But GT Health Department Director of Community Health Jacalyn Money-Bruno said Grand Traverse County's immunization rates are not where they should be.

""It's safe, it's a highly effective vaccine,"" she said. ""And unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation out there and a lot of distrust... If people have questions, they can call us. They can make an appointment, and we're happy to talk through it.""

Children typically receive 2 shots of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine: once when they're 12 to 15 months old and another when they're 4 to 6 years old.

Because measles is so contagious, 95% of a population needs to be fully vaccinated in order to claim herd immunity -- the point at which a population becomes mostly resistant to a disease.

In March [2025], IPR News found that most northern Michigan counties fall below 95% for the rates of children 19-35 months old that have received at least one MMR vaccine.

""This case is a reminder of how easily measles can spread and the importance of vaccination,"" said Mike Lahey, Health Officer at GT Health Department. ""The vaccine is highly effective, and we strongly encourage our community to educate themselves about their immunization status and to get vaccinated if they are not protected.""

Health officials are encouraging anyone who may have symptoms to go to a hospital or urgent care to prevent spreading the disease.

Антиваксеры в Татарстане способствуют возвращению забытых инфекций
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
В России в прошлом году резко выросло число случаев кори, коклюша и краснухи. По данным Роспотребнадзора, в 2024 году корью заболели в 11 раз чаще, чем в 2023-м, коклюшем — в 4,5 раза, краснухой — в 6 раз. Почти 90% заболевших не были привиты. В ведомстве уверены: причина — отказ от вакцинации, что мешает формированию коллективного иммунитета.
По информации регионального управления Роспотребнадзора, в республике Татарстан заболеваемость корью выросла в 2,5 раза, хотя по коклюшу наоборот снизилась на треть. Однако число отказов от прививки по-прежнему велико — только от вакцинации против кори отказались 2,5 тысячи человек.
По последним данным, за пять месяцев 2025 года в республике зарегистрировано 49 случаев кори и 36 — коклюша. Это в несколько раз меньше, чем годом ранее. На начало года план по вакцинации выполнен на 40%, что соответствует норме. С апреля проводится дополнительная вакцинация непривитых и однократно привитых против кори, а также ревакцинация детей от коклюша. Уже привито 59 тысяч детей.
Несмотря на всё это, в Татарстане коллективный иммунитет к таким заболеваниям, как дифтерия, столбняк и краснуха, уже сформирован — он составляет 96%, при норме в 95%. Достичь 100% невозможно из-за медицинских отводов, да и в этом нет необходимости — важно лишь удерживать текущий уровень.

С начала года в Воронежской области корь выявили у 11 человек
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
За первые пять месяцев 2025 года в Воронежской области было зафиксировано всего 11 случаев заболевания корью.
Это значительно меньше, чем годом ранее — в 2024-м диагноз «корь» получили 377 жителей региона, включая 236 детей до 17 лет и 141 взрослого человека.
Стоит напомнить, что еще в первой половине предыдущего года регион столкнулся с резким ростом числа заражений этой болезнью — число больных увеличилось почти в 33 раза. С января по июль 2024-го врачи диагностировали корь у 366 человек (из них 227 детей и 139 взрослых), хотя за тот же период 2023 года заболели лишь 11 пациентов (восьмеро детей и трое взрослых).
По данным регионального управления Роспотребнадзора, вспышка кори продолжалась около полутора лет — с весны 2023-го по осень 2024-го. Увеличение числа заболевших связано с естественным циклом подъема инфекции, который усугубился пандемией коронавируса, когда многие жители оказались непривитыми от кори. В последние месяцы 2024 года и зимой-весной 2025-го новых заболеваний в области не фиксировалось.

В Юте подтверждены новые случаи кори, в том числе у детей
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
В Юте выявлены новые случаи кори, в том числе, первый у ребенка. Официальные лица штата призывают людей, которые подверглись возможному воздействию вируса кори, звонить перед поездкой в клинику или больницу.
По данным Департамента здравоохранения и социальных служб штата Юта, четвертый и пятый жители этого штата были инфицированы корью. Одним из недавно инфицированных является ребенок. Один из двух новых пациентов живет в округе Юта, а второй - в юго-западной части штата. Ни один из пяти человек с подтвержденными инфекциями до сих пор не был вакцинирован. Две пациентки до заражения корью были беременны. Двое из людей с диагнозом корь были госпитализированы из-за осложнений.
Более 90% жителей штата Юта вакцинированы и защищены. На юге Юты есть районы, где непропорционально большое количество невакцинированных людей по сравнению с остальной частью штата. В четверг департамент рекомендовал людям, планирующим забеременеть, пройти вакцинацию, чтобы защитить себя и своего ребенка.
По данным Центров по контролю и профилактике заболеваний, по состоянию на вторник в США было зарегистрировано 1 227 подтвержденных случаев кори в 37 штатах.
О первом подтвержденном случае кори, возникшем в штате Юта, было объявлено 20 июня. Во вторник было объявлено о втором и третьем известных случаях.

Корь на подъеме в Калифорнии: в этом году случаев больше, чем за весь 2024 год
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
В 2025 г. в Калифорнии зарегистрировано больше случаев заболевания корью, чем за весь 2024 год. По данным Департамента общественного здравоохранения штата, в 2025 г. году было зарегистрировано 17 случаев заболевания корью среди жителей Калифорнии, по сравнению с 15 случаями за весь 2023 г.
США переживает крупнейшую вспышку этого заболевания за последние десятилетия. По всей стране в 2024 г. году более 145 человек были госпитализированы с корью, и многие из них нуждались в интенсивной терапии. CDC сообщает, что 95% случаев заболевания корью в этом году в США произошли среди людей, которые либо не были вакцинированы, либо имели неизвестный статус вакцинации. Около 29% случаев произошли среди детей младше 5 лет, а еще 37% - в возрасте от 5 до 19 лет.
Значительная вспышка кори началась в Техасе в начале 2025 г. и с тех пор распространилась на соседние штаты. В Техасе зарегистрировано не менее 750 случаев заболевания корью; в Нью-Мексико - 81; в Канзасе - 80; в Северной Дакоте - 28 и в Монтане - 23 случая. Мичиган сообщил о 15 случаях; Огайо и Иллинойс – по 10, Арканзас и Индиана – по восемь.
По данным CDC, подавляющее большинство случаев кори связано со вспышками, связанными со сплоченными сообществами с низким уровнем вакцинации. Недавние вспышки произошли в районах с заметным населением определенных меннонитских христианских общин, начиная с прошлой осени в Онтарио, Канада, что было связано с большим собранием в Нью-Брансуике; затем в Техасе и Нью-Мексико в конце января; и совсем недавно в мексиканском штате Чиуауа. Официальные лица в Мексике и США сообщают, что вспышки в их странах соответствуют штамму, обнаруженному в Канаде.
По данным CDC, в этом году было зарегистрировано три случая смерти от кори. Двое из них были детьми школьного возраста из Техаса, оба они не были вакцинированы и не имели известных сопутствующих заболеваний, по словам представителей здравоохранения штата. Еще один был непривитым взрослым в Нью-Мексико, который не обращался за медицинской помощью перед смертью.
По данным Всемирной организации здравоохранения, в Мексике зарегистрирован один случай смерти. Этот человек также не был вакцинирован. В этом году в Канаде также было зарегистрировано более 3300 подтвержденных и предполагаемых случаев кори. Один младенец, который был инфицирован корью до рождения недоношенным, умер в Канаде в начале этого месяца. Мать младенца не была вакцинирована.
В 2025 г. в США впервые с 2003 года умер ребенок от кори, у ребенка было редкое генетическое заболевание, которое нарушило работу иммунной системы. Это также первый случай с 1990-х годов, когда более двух человек умерли от кори в США за один год.
Вспышки кори в Техасе, Канзасе и Нью-Мексико настолько серьезны, что чиновники здравоохранения штата рекомендуют раннюю вакцинацию младенцев в возрасте от 6 месяцев в наиболее пострадавших округах. Эти чиновники также рекомендуют многим детям вторую дозу раньше, чем обычно.
Стандартная рекомендация CDC заключается в том, что дети должны получать первую из двух прививок от кори, когда им исполняется 1 год, если они не путешествуют за границу, и в этом случае они могут получить прививку в возрасте 6 месяцев.
В настоящее время в Калифорнии нет активной вспышки кори, поэтому нет никаких рекомендаций по дополнительным или ускоренным дозам вакцины. Большинство случаев заболевания корью в Калифорнии в этом году были связаны с людьми, которые путешествовали за границу. По данным CDC, в 2023-24 учебном году 96,2% детей в детских садах Калифорнии были вакцинированы против кори, что является одним из самых высоких показателей среди всех штатов.

Whooping cough cases in Japan exceed 31 000, 8-fold rise from 2024
------------------------
More than 31 000 people have caught whooping cough this year [2025] in Japan, a nearly 8-fold rise from last year [2024] that has already surpassed the annual record-high number logged in 2019, data by a national health research institute showed Tuesday [24 Jun 2025].

The country's health authorities are calling on the public to be aware of the highly contagious bacterial infection that causes severe coughing spells that experts say are most dangerous in infants and could result in death in the age group.

According to a preliminary data released by the Japan Institute for Health Security, a total of 31 966 cases have been detected nationwide from the start of the year [2025], with 2970 patients reported in the week ending 15 Jun [2025].

In the week before [week of 1 Jun 2025], weekly cases surpassed 3000 for the first time since 2018 when comparable data became available.

By comparison, the total number of cases last year [2024] was around 4000, and the 16 845 cases registered in 2019 was the record high for a year.

Many of the patients have been 19 and under, and concerns remain that infants may contract the disease from their older siblings at home.

Whooping cough spreads easily from person to person mainly through droplets produced by coughing or sneezing. The first symptoms generally appear 7 to 10 days after infection, such as mild fever and runny nose, followed by a hacking cough and a whooping sound when breathing, according to the World Health Organization.

Pneumonia is a relatively common complication, and seizures and brain disease occasionally occur, according to the WHO. Antibiotics are used to treat the infection, it says.

Puntland Issues Urgent Health Warning as Deadly Infectious Children Disease Spreads in Mudug
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authorities in Puntland's Mudug region have issued a public health alert following the outbreak of diphtheria, a dangerous infectious disease that is primarily affecting children. The disease, locally referred to as ""Gawracatada,"" has already claimed the lives of several children, prompting urgent action from regional health officials.

In a statement released on Friday [27 Jun 2025], the Mudug Regional Administration called on parents and guardians to seek immediate medical attention for any child exhibiting symptoms. Officials did not disclose specific symptoms in the initial statement but emphasized the disease's rapid transmission and deadly impact.

""The public is urged to take affected children to health centers without delay,"" the administration said.

As part of emergency containment measures, authorities have also banned gatherings of unvaccinated children, including attendance at schools, playgrounds, and other public areas where young people congregate.

The ban takes effect immediately and applies to all children who have not received vaccinations, though the administration did not specify which vaccine or disease strain is involved.

The outbreak has triggered growing concern in the region, where health infrastructure is already under strain and access to preventive care remains limited in rural areas.

Health officials are working to investigate the source of the outbreak and assess the risk of further spread. The Puntland Ministry of Health is expected to issue a more detailed advisory in the coming days.

Local residents are being urged to follow preventive health guidelines and remain vigilant as authorities monitor the situation closely.

Pakistan has reported its 13th polio case of 2025, with the latest infection confirmed in an 18-month-old child from Tank district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). This marks the seventh case from the province this year [2025], according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The child is from Union Council Amakhel, and the virus was confirmed by the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication. With this new case, KP continues to be the most affected province, followed by Sindh with four cases, and Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan with one case each.

This latest detection follows closely behind another case in Bannu, reported just last week. The government remains concerned as multiple cases continue to emerge despite 3 nationwide anti-polio campaigns already conducted in February, April, and May.

Polio remains endemic only in Pakistan and Afghanistan, making both countries key to global eradication efforts. However, security challenges, vaccine misinformation, and public hesitancy often hamper progress. In May [2025], Pakistan's health ministry launched a campaign to vaccinate 45 million children under 5.

Federal Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal praised frontline workers and law enforcement officials for their role in this critical mission. ""This fight demands continued sacrifice and unity,"" he said, vowing to eliminate the disease by year-end. Polio is incurable, but it can be prevented through repeated oral polio vaccines during every campaign.

Bolivia reports 74 cases of measles, declares national emergency
----------------------------------------------------------------

Bolivia has recorded 74 cases of measles, most of them in the province of Santa Cruz, the government said on Sunday [29 Jun 2025].

Authorities have confirmed the increase in cases in the last 2 months in 3 of the 9 departments of the Andean country. Of the total cases, 68 are in Santa Cruz, which has 3.1 million inhabitants. As a result, on Tuesday [24 June 2025] a national health emergency was declared.

""In Santa Cruz, the outbreak is distributed in 10 municipalities,"" said the deputy minister of epidemiological surveillance at the Ministry of Health, Max Enríquez. ""A week ago we had reported 60 cases, today we are talking about 74,"" he added to the Sunday [29 Jun 2025] program of state broadcaster Bolivia TV.

Enríquez also said that the government is waiting for ""the results of 600 suspected cases that can be confirmed as positive."" Among the first measures announced are the anticipation of school holidays in the department of Santa Cruz, the epicenter of the outbreak, and the adoption of remote classes in the cities of La Paz, El Alto and Potosí.

The first case was detected in April 2025 in a 1-year-and-2-month-old child, residing in Santa Cruz, with a history of travel to Brazil.

Enríquez states that ""Bolivia was declared a measles-free country in 2016 thanks to intensive vaccination campaigns,"" but emphasized that to maintain this status, it is essential to achieve immunization coverage of more than 95%.

On Saturday [28 Jun 2025], the country received a donation from Venezuela of 100 000 doses of vaccines against measles, rubella and mumps to reinforce its vaccination campaigns.

[Editado por Jaime Torres]


El sarampión ha vuelto y lo ha hecho con mayor fuerza. La propagación de la enfermedad en varios países del continente, desde el norte al sur, mantiene en alerta a las autoridades sanitarias nacionales en Canadá, Estados Unidos y México, países con brotes activos y donde el resurgimiento de la enfermedad ya causa alarma y el reforzamiento de los mecanismos de prevención y vacunación masiva de la población. 

En Canadá, las autoridades sanitarias han documentado, hasta el 14 de junio de 2025, un total de 3.381 casos de sarampión (3.081 confirmados y 300 casos probables o sospechosos) repartidos en 9 jurisdicciones: Alberta, Columbia Británica, Manitoba, Territorios del Noroeste, Nueva Escocia, Ontario, Isla del Príncipe Eduardo, Quebec y Saskatchewan.

Este año, Estados Unidos registró el segundo número más alto de casos de sarampión desde que declaró la eliminación de la enfermedad en el 2000. Los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) reportaron 1.227 casos de sarampión hasta el martes 24 de junio —con brotes activos en 15 estados— de los cuales 1.088 contagios están vinculados con estos brotes y 139 casos aislados en casi todo el territorio relacionados con viajes internacionales.

El brote actual en esas zonas, considerado el mayor en lo que va de siglo, se cree que se originó en la frontera entre México y Estados Unidos, en una comunidad menonita que rechaza la vacunación y que se desplaza entre ambos lados de la frontera. El brote se intensificó rápidamente, propagándose a a Nuevo México, Oklahoma y Kansas.

En México, el brote de sarampión que en principio afectó a estados del norte, ya se ha propagado hacia el sur, convirtiéndose en un tema nacional: hay más de 2.500 casos confirmados, la enfermedad se ha extendido hacia la mitad del país —con contagios en 18 de los 32 estados— y los expertos hablan de “emergencia”. En el estado fronterizo de Chihuahua se concentra la mayoría de los casos confirmados; pero los contagios también crecen progresivamente en Sonora, Guanajuato, Zacatecas, Coahuila, Durango y Michoacán.

Peor aún, en México hay un total de 5.410 casos probables o sospechosos en todo el país y la enfermedad ha provocado al menos nueve muertes, a diferencia de Estados Unidos, donde han muerto tres personas: dos niños en Texas y un adulto en Nuevo México, todos ellos sin vacunar. Mientras que en Canadá, un bebé nacido prematuramente murió a principios de mes en la provincia de Ontario por contagio a través de su madre no vacunada. 

La Organización Mundial de la Salud ha advertido de que “el riesgo general de sarampión en la región de las Américas se considera elevado”. Según el organismo, las bajas tasas de vacunación son un factor clave en esta evaluación de riesgo elevado.

“Hay un número cada vez mayor de personas susceptibles debido a la baja cobertura continua, impulsada por factores como la pandemia de Covid-19, la reticencia a las vacunas y el acceso limitado a la atención médica, especialmente entre grupos vulnerables como migrantes, personas desplazadas y poblaciones indígenas”, indicó la OMS.

En Honduras, la Secretaría de Salud declaró la alerta nacional por amenaza de sarampión, ante el incremento de casos en países vecinos como Belice.
 
Más al sur, en Bolivia, el Gobierno declaró el 24 de junio la emergencia sanitaria nacional por los casos de sarampión, que suman a la fecha 74, tras una reunión de urgencia del Consejo Nacional Estratégico para Emergencias Sanitarias. El país tiene en vigilancia, además, ""más de 600 casos sospechosos"", según las autoridades.

""Ante la epidemia de sarampión que atraviesa el país y el alto riesgo de propagación de esta enfermedad, hemos decidido declarar emergencia sanitaria a nivel nacional con el firme propósito de proteger la salud y la vida del pueblo boliviano"", publicó el presidente Luis Arce en su cuenta de Facebook. El Gobierno recibió 100.000 vacunas donadas por Venezuela que se aplicarán en la región de Santa Cruz y adelanta gestiones para conseguir más.
 
En 2024, el continente fue declarado como libre de sarampión por la Organización Panamericana de la Salud, pero los últimos brotes este año han venido a poner en riesgo este importante logro. Jarbas Barbosa, director del organismo desde febrero de 2023, dijo al diario español 'El País', que la región de las Américas es la única con esta distinción. “Todas las demás tienen mucha transmisión de sarampión”, afirmó.

“Lo primero es tener una vacunación del 95% con las dos dosis de la vacuna de manera homogénea. Muchas veces la cobertura general es buena, pero hay una comunidad que por alguna razón cultural, religiosa u otras no tiene una buena aceptación de la vacuna”, explica Barbosa.

Una parte importante de los brotes de sarampión en Estados Unidos, Canadá y México se originó en comunidades menonitas estrechamente vinculadas entre sí, y que históricamente han tenido bajas tasas de vacunación debido en gran parte a las mínimas interacciones con los sistemas formales de atención sanitaria.

A esto se suma que la protección contra el sarampión en particular cayó en 100 países entre 2010 y 2019, desmantelando décadas de progreso, incluso en países ricos que previamente habían eliminado la enfermedad altamente infecciosa, según un análisis de las tendencias mundiales de vacunación publicado en la revista científica 'The Lancet'.

Pero tras la pandemia de COVID-19, los índices de cobertura descendieron, y se calcula que 15,6 millones de niños no recibieron la vacuna contra la difteria, el tétanos y la tos ferina, ni la vacuna contra el sarampión. Según la OMS, el sarampión se ha multiplicado por 11 en las Américas este año en comparación con 2024. Mientras que las infecciones por sarampión se duplicaron en Europa en 2024 con respecto al año anterior y la enfermedad sigue siendo frecuente en África y el sudeste asiático.

El discurso antivacunas y el retiro de financiamiento a las campañas internacionales también entran en la ecuación. El secretario de Salud de Estados Unidos, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., afirma que el país retirará su apoyo a la alianza de vacunas Gavi, diciendo que la organización ha “ignorado la ciencia” y “perdido la confianza del público”.

Gavi es una asociación público-privada que incluye a la OMS, Unicef, la Fundación Gates y el Banco Mundial. Ha financiado la vacunación de más de 1.000 millones de niños a través de programas de inmunización sistemática, salvando unos 18 millones de vidas. Estados Unidos ha sido durante mucho tiempo uno de sus mayores partidarios.

Kennedy ha estado cambiando la política nacional de vacunas de EE. UU. desde su nombramiento a principios de este año. Recientemente, despidió a todos los miembros de un grupo asesor sobre vacunas y los sustituyó por miembros de su propia elección, entre los que se encuentran varios que comparten sentimientos antivacunas.

En mayo, Kennedy apareció en una reunión de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, donde calificó a ese organismo de “moribundo” e instó a otros países a seguir el ejemplo de Estados Unidos y abandonarla, tal como anunció Donald Trump el primer día de su presidencia. Estados Unidos es el mayor aportante de la OMS.

Bolívia relata 74 casos de sarampo e decreta emergência nacional
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Bolívia registra 74 casos de sarampo, a maioria na província de Santa Cruz, informou o governo neste domingo (29) [junho/2025].

As autoridades confirmaram o aumento de casos nos últimos dois meses em três dos nove departamentos do país andino. Do total de casos, 68 estão em Santa Cruz, que tem 3,1 milhões de habitantes. Com isso, na terça-feira (24) [junho/2025] foi decretada emergência sanitária nacional.

""Em Santa Cruz, o surto está distribuído em dez municípios"", disse o vice-ministro de vigilância epidemiológica do Ministério da Saúde, Max Enríquez. ""Uma semana atrás havíamos informado 60 casos, hoje estamos falando de 74"", acrescentou ao programa dominical da emissora estatal Bolivia TV.

Enríquez disse ainda que o governo aguarda ""os resultados de 600 casos suspeitos que podem ser confirmados como positivos"".

Entre as primeiras medidas anunciadas estão a antecipação das férias escolares no departamento de Santa Cruz, epicentro do surto, e adoção de aulas remotas nas cidades de La Paz, El Alto e Potosí.

O primeiro caso foi detectado em abril [2025] em uma criança de 1 ano e 2 meses de idade, residente em Santa Cruz, com histórico de viagem ao Brasil [qual a data do início dos sintomas? Quais as datas de ida e retorno ao/do Brasil? Qual(ais) o(s) destino(s) no Brasil? Qual meio de transporte? Houve contato com casos suspeitos ou confirmados no Brasil? - Mod. RNA].

Enríquez afirma que ""a Bolívia foi declarada um país livre de sarampo em 2016 graças a campanhas intensivas de vacinação"", mas enfatizou que, para manter esse status, é fundamental alcançar coberturas superiores a 95% de imunização.

No sábado (28) [junho/2025], o país recebeu uma doação da Venezuela de 100 mil doses de vacinas contra sarampo, rubéola e caxumba para reforçar suas campanhas de vacinação.

Pakistan has reported another polio case from Khyber Pakhtun­khwa (KP), bringing the total number of cases in the country for 2025 to 14.

The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) has confirmed the latest polio case from District North Waziristan in southern KP.

""A 19-month-old boy from Union Council Mir­an­shah-3, District North Waziristan, has been confirmed as the 8th polio case from KP this year [2025]. With this latest detection, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 14 -- including 8 from KP, 4 from Sindh, and 1 each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,"" an official from the laboratory said.

""Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under the age of 5 during each campaign, along with timely completion of all essential immunisations,"" he said.

""While nationwide efforts to eradicate polio continue to improve the quality of vaccination campaigns, the southern districts of KP remain a major concern due to limited access and challenges in conducting house-to-house vaccination. These obstacles result in missed opportunities, leaving thousands of children unvaccinated and vulnerable to poliovirus,"" the official said.

""A special vaccination activity was conducted in 6 union councils of Bannu from 23 to 28 Jun 2025, during which 17 485 children received the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). A similar targeted vaccination drive is being planned in 11 union councils of North Waziristan.

""Additionally, preparations are underway for a large-scale special vaccination campaign in southern KP, scheduled for August [2025],"" he further said.

""Recent polio cases in southern KP are a stark reminder that children missed during vaccination campaigns remain at serious risk. While the programme is making every effort to reach every child, the role of parents is critical. Ensuring every child receives every dose of the polio vaccine is not just important -- it's urgent,"" he emphasised.

The majority of those affected are children and adolescents of school age, while no children under 1 year have been diagnosed, and only 2 adults were hospitalized as a precaution, both of whom have since been discharged without complications.

Cases with symptoms continue to be under epidemiological surveillance and home medical follow-up. The specialist clarified that some infections may evolve into viral conditions of different etiologies, ceasing to be hepatitis A.

As a preventive measure, immunization with gamma-globulin was administered to contacts of suspected cases and to individuals under 18 years old in the area, as well as to workers and residents of nearby vulnerable centers.

The actions implemented by the regime to halt the spread of the disease include active screening, health hearings, controlled distribution and sale of 1% sodium hypochlorite, and the temporary suspension of food services by self-employed individuals in the affected area.

Additionally, the sanitation efforts by Hydrology and Community Services have intensified, as they have cleared storm drainage systems, eliminated over 60 leaks in the drinking water network, and cleaned the oxidation lagoon, issues that have complicated the hygiene and health situation in Cárdenas, but which had not been addressed.

Authorities have stated that control measures will remain in place for up to 50 days after the last suspected case and emphasize the need to maintain strict hygiene measures, such as frequent hand washing, surface disinfection, and the consumption of boiled or treated water with bleach.

In May 2025, there was an alert regarding a hepatitis outbreak that had spread in that city in Matanzas. Outbreaks of hepatitis A were detected in the neighborhoods of 13 de Marzo and La Marina.

The increase in cases of this disease in Cuba is directly related to the consumption of water contaminated with feces. The lack of access to safe drinking water and poor hygiene conditions have exacerbated this situation, reflecting the inefficiency of the Cuban government in ensuring an adequate sanitary environment for its population.

Mumps Cases and Outbreaks
-------------------------

Key Points
--------
- U.S. mumps cases decreased significantly after the mumps vaccine program began in 1967, but they have increased since 2006.
- Most recent outbreaks have occurred in settings with intense or frequent close contact, such as college campuses or close-knit communities.
- These outbreaks and their circulation across the country highlight the importance of high vaccination coverage to limit mumps outbreaks.

Mumps outbreaks still happen
----------------------------
After the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. However, mumps outbreaks still occur, particularly in settings where people have close, prolonged contact, such as universities, schools, and correctional facilities.

During these outbreaks, people who previously had 1 or 2 doses of MMR vaccine can still get mumps. Experts aren't sure why vaccinated people still get mumps, but some evidence suggests that:

- Some people's immune systems may not respond as well as they should to the vaccine.
- The mumps vaccine may produce antibodies (proteins created by the body's immune system to help fight infections) that are not as effective against wild-type virus strains.
- In some people, antibodies from mumps vaccination may decrease overtime, until they no longer protect the person from mumps.
- As most people are not routinely exposed to mumps, there is less immunologic boosting (where people are exposed to mumps which boosts their immunity, but they do not get sick).
- Disease symptoms are milder and complications are less frequent in vaccinated people. High vaccination coverage also helps to limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks. So, it's still very important to be up to date on MMR vaccine.

During a mumps outbreak, public health authorities might recommend an additional dose of MMR vaccine for people who belong to groups at increased risk for getting mumps. These groups are usually those who are likely to have close contact, such as sharing sport equipment or drinks, kissing, or living in close quarters, with a person who has mumps.

Your local public health authorities or institution will notify you if you are at increased risk and should receive this additional dose. If you already have 2 doses of MMR, it is not necessary to seek out vaccination unless the authorities tell you that you are part of this group.

Before mumps vaccine was available in the United States, most children got mumps by the time they reached adolescence. Reported cases decreased by more than 99% after both the mumps vaccination program started in the United States in 1967 children regularly received 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Cases decreased from 152 209 in 1968 to 231 in 2003. However, reported U.S. mumps cases and outbreaks increased since 2006. Most of these cases were in young adults and vaccinated people. Large outbreaks happened in settings where people have intense or frequent close contact, like college campuses, close-knit communities, and large gatherings.

Четыре случая кори выявили в Забайкалье в период с 10 по 20 июня. Инфицированными оказались члены семьи, которые прибыли из Москвы, сообщила пресс-служба регионального управления Роспотребнадзора. Об этом передает ИА StolicaMedia со ссылкой на ИА ChitaMedia.
Указывается, что мать и трое детей четырех, восьми и 12 лет прилетела 28 мая в Читу к бабушке. Несовершеннолетние не были привиты от кори. Причиной стал отказ матери от прививки. В итоге заболел один ребенок, который контактировал в школе с зараженным. В Читу он прилетел во время инкубационного периода.
Сейчас все заболевшие находятся в краевой инфекционной больнице. Там они будут находиться под наблюдением врачей до 11 июля. 
Прежде сообщалось о вспышке кори в Москве. Так, в конце мая и начале июня в нескольких столичных вузах был введен карантин.

Kyrgyzstan: Measles Situation 2025 - DREF Operational Update (MDRKG021)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Republican Center for Immunoprophylaxis of the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic informed that as of 17 Jun 2025, 8558 suspected cases of measles and rubella were registered in the country. Of these, 8211 cases are classified as measles, including 982 laboratory confirmed cases, 3590 clinically confirmed cases and 3639 epidemiologically related cases. The incidence rate is 112.8 per 100 000 population.

Territorial breakdown of measles cases out of the total number of cases is as follows: in Osh city - 549 cases, Chui region - 962 cases, Talas region - 201 cases, Naryn region - 142 cases, Batken region - 265 cases; Osh oblast - 629 cases, Jalal-Abad region - 467 cases and Issyk-Kul region 107 cases. Jalal-Abad region is emerging as the next most affected region after Bishkek city, Osh and Chui regions, with 467 confirmed cases of measles reported as of 17 Jun 2025.

Analysis of vaccination status of patients diagnosed with measles by the RCI shows that the majority of them (94%, or 7724 people) were not vaccinated and only 6% were vaccinated. A closer analysis shows that of those who were vaccinated, 3% or 274 patients received 1 dose of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella and 3% or 213 patients received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, which shows the protective nature of the full dose of vaccination.

The majority of those who got sick with measles were getting sick before they reach their vaccine-eligible age (30% or 2502 people), or due to refusals of vaccination (44%, or 3621 children). The remaining reasons for not getting vaccinated were medical exemptions (8% or 688 cases) and migration (2% or 152 cases). A total of 761 patients had an unknown vaccination status (9%).

The current epidemiological situation in the country for measles and rubella has deteriorated since the beginning of 2025. The government of the Kyrgyz Republic has not officially declared an outbreak.

As of 3 Jun 2025, the government announced 9 confirmed deaths due to complications of measles. In comparison, 9 measles related deaths were reported in 2023 and 5 deaths in 2024.

In the previous epidemic of measles that happened in 2023 and 2024 (7046 cases of measles reported in 2023 and 14 380 cases of measles in 2024), a similar age distribution was observed and therefore, the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic has lowered a vaccine eligible age for the 1st dose of MMR vaccine from 2 years to 1 year old and for the 2nd dose, from 6 years old to 2 years old in 2024.

The situation in Kyrgyzstan is reflecting a wider regional trend of the increasing number of measles cases across WHO Europe and Central Asia region. It is possible that the current numbers of measles in the country are underestimated.

The primary cause of the ongoing measles situations in the country is the large number of susceptible children who have not received full vaccination doses according to the national immunization schedule. There is a growing anti-vaccination sentiment in the country. The Republican Immunoprophylaxis Centre has received a growing number of reports of vaccination refusals since 2016. In 2021, there were more than 10 000 refusals, in 2023, there were 20 496 refusals reported, and in 2024 -- 19 760 refusals were reported. Out of those 19 760 refusals, 9664 cases were reported in Bishkek city (49% of all refusals) and 4292 cases in Chui region (21% of all refusals) alone. Reasons for parents and caregivers refusal of vaccination are often due to religious beliefs, lack of trust in health system and misinformation.

As the immunization schedule was changed in 2024, there is a lack of awareness among the population of the revised immunization schedule and many children who were above the age of 2 in 2024 remain in the risk group. As it has been in the previous epidemics of measles, there is a spike of cases after major holidays, after the start of the academic year in September and during the cold seasons.

Edo State government said yesterday [30 Jun 2025] that 15 suspected cases of diphtheria disease had been recorded, with 6 infected and 3 dead. The state is also responding proactively to emerging health concerns in the wake of the recent diphtheria outbreak.

The Commissioner for Health, Dr Cyril Oshiomhole, stated this while launching the state's Rural Healthcare Initiative. Oshiomhole disclosed that the Ministry of Health, in collaboration with the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, and the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, UBTH, had launched a statewide surveillance and vaccination campaign.

""We are not waiting for numbers to escalate before taking action. We are actively educating communities, administering booster doses, and prioritising early intervention. Diphtheria is vaccine preventable, and we are doing everything to ensure that people understand this,"" the commissioner said.

According to him, the administration has set in motion one of the most robust and inclusive health reforms in the history of the state. At the heart of this new direction is a grassroots-driven health insurance model that extends subsidised medical plans to rural dwellers who previously lacked access to even the most basic healthcare services. These plans are designed not as charity, but as ""sustainable social investments"" that will serve as the financial foundation for revitalising primary healthcare centres across the state.

Oshiomhole disclosed that with a vibrant and well-funded health insurance scheme, we can fix our healthcare infrastructure and ensure that these facilities are operational, well-staffed, and accountable. He added that government is expanding insurance coverage and also investing heavily in public health education, infrastructural rehabilitation, and human capacity development.

The commissioner announced that a team of health educators had been deployed to communities across the 3 senatorial zones, where they are engaging in direct, in-language sensitisation on hygiene, vaccination, and general wellness practices.

He also disclosed that the health revolution also include strong partnership with the media to deepen public awareness, just as government is working closely with the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, and other media platforms to amplify health messages and encourage citizen participation.

La hepatitis A ha resurgido en Argentina. El país enfrenta un brote preocupante, con 69 casos reportados en el primer semestre de 2025, cifra que iguala los casos registrados durante todo 2024.
El Ministerio de Salud confirmó la situación y advirtió sobre la caída alarmante en las tasas de vacunación, que se encuentran un 80% por debajo del umbral necesario para mantener la inmunidad colectiva. En una entrevista con Luis Mino, el doctor Luis Gaite, hepatólogo y especialista en enfermedades hepáticas, destacó que este rebrote no solo se debe a la falta de vacunación, sino también a las consecuencias de la postpandemia, que generaron una caída tanto en la vacunación obligatoria de niños como en la vacunación electiva de adultos. ""Es una enfermedad prevenible con una sola dosis de vacuna"", explicó Gaite, quien instó a la población a conocer su estatus de hepatitis y a vacunarse, especialmente los adultos con factores de riesgo.
El doctor Gaite también hizo hincapié en la disponibilidad de la vacuna en los centros de salud del país, especialmente en Santa Fe, donde los ciudadanos pueden acceder a la vacuna sin necesidad de orden médica. /La vacuna está disponible en todos los centros de salud y vacunatorios principales, como en el Hospital JB Iturraspe y en el centro oncológico de la ciudad. ""Es importante que las personas consulten su estatus y, si es necesario, se vacunen"", recomendó el especialista.

La caída en la tasa de vacunación es una alarma que debe ser atendida urgentemente, ya que, como dijo Gaite, ""cuando más casos hay, mayor es el riesgo de que aparezcan casos graves"". La hepatitis A, aunque generalmente no grave, puede convertirse en un problema serio si se deja de lado la prevención adecuada.

Hepatitis A outbreak in Argentina: cases increase in 2025 and vaccination fell by 80%
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hepatitis A has resurfaced in Argentina. The country is facing a worrying outbreak, with 69 cases reported in the 1st half of 2025, a figure that equals the cases registered during all of 2024.

The Ministry of Health confirmed the situation and warned of an alarming drop in vaccination rates, which are 80% below the threshold needed to maintain herd immunity.

In an interview with Luis Mino, Dr. Luis Gaite, hepatologist and specialist in liver diseases, stressed that this outbreak is not only due to the lack of vaccination, but also to the consequences of the post-pandemic, which generated a drop in both the mandatory vaccination of children and the elective vaccination of adults.

""It is a disease preventable with vaccine,"" explained Gaite, who urged the population to know their hepatitis status and to get vaccinated, especially adults with risk factors.

Dr. Gaite also emphasized the availability of the vaccine in the country's health centers, especially in Santa Fe, where citizens can access the vaccine without the need for a medical order. The vaccine is available at all major health and vaccination centers, such as the JB Iturraspe Hospital and the city's cancer center.

""It is important that people check their status and, if necessary, get vaccinated,"" the specialist recommended.

The drop in the vaccination rate is an alarm that must be addressed urgently, since, as Gaite said, ""the more cases there are, the greater the risk of serious cases appearing.""

Hepatitis A, while usually not serious, can become a serious problem if proper prevention is neglected.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background
----------
Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease with cutaneous or respiratory manifestation, caused by diphtheria toxin-producing (toxigenic) corynebacteria, mainly _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ or zoonotic _Corynebacterium ulcerans_. The pathogen is usually transmitted through contact with a patient or a person carrying the bacterium in their throat or on their skin. Classical respiratory diphtheria results from local and systemic spread of diphtheria toxin causing a pseudomembranous inflammation of the upper respiratory tract as well as acute systemic toxicity, myocarditis, and polyneuritis. The incubation period is usually 1-5 days with a maximum of 10 days. Depending on the settings, the complications can give rise to a case fatality rate of 5-30% [1], even with treatment. The period of communicability lasts until virulent corynebacteriae have disappeared from the lesions they produce, usually in ≤  2 weeks, and seldom > 4 weeks for respiratory diphtheria in untreated people [1,2].

In countries with adequate vaccination coverage, diphtheria is rare. In Germany, the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) recommends basic immunization against diphtheria at the age of 2, 4 and 11 months, followed by booster vaccinations at the age of 5-6 years and 9-16 years [3]. In adulthood, a booster vaccination is recommended every 10 years. Vaccination coverage for the primary vaccination series against diphtheria at the age of 6 years is high (89%) [4].

Diphtheria outbreaks occur rarely in Germany and sporadic diphtheria cases are uncommon with only a few annually reported cases. According to the German Infection Protection Act, mandatory notification of all toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ is required in Germany since 2001 and was extended to all toxigenic _Corynebacterium_ spp. in 2017. Upon clinical suspicion or diagnosis, the treating physician, and upon laboratory detection, laboratories diagnosing toxigenic corynebacteria are obliged to notify the responsible local public health authority. Recommendations include submission of isolates from suspected cases of diphtheria to the German National Consiliary Laboratory for Diphtheria (GNCLD) in Oberschleißheim, for further confirmatory testing including testing for toxigenicity and molecular typing, e.g., whole-genome sequencing (WGS) [5].

Outbreak detection
----------------
In September 2024, a school-aged child (P1) presented with clinical signs of tonsillitis to a general practitioner. On the next day, and with clinical deterioration, P1 was admitted to a primary hospital, now presenting with severe tonsillitis, a pseudomembrane and lymph node swelling. P1 was unvaccinated against diphtheria. A nasopharyngeal swab obtained on hospital admission grew _C. diphtheriae_. The isolate was sent to the GNCLD for toxigenicity testing, where it was named KL3499 and tested toxigenic. Based on the clinical suspicion of diphtheria, the patient received antibiotic therapy with penicillin and diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) under intensive care observation and was transferred to a tertiary referral hospital due to severe deterioration of health including cardiac, renal, and respiratory involvement requiring invasive ventilation and intensive care. P1 eventually succumbed to the illness in January 2025.

The event was considered unusual as it involved the death of a child in the local population. For comparison: 3 respiratory diphtheria cases caused by _C. diphtheriae_ were notified in Germany between 2001 and 2022 -- all of them adults, 2 infections imported, none fatal. In 2022, there were 13 cases of respiratory diphtheria as part of an international outbreak of diphtheria among newly arriving migrants -- mainly young adults, all infections imported, no deaths occurred in Germany.

Here, we describe the epidemiological, microbiological, and molecular outbreak investigations of the fatal case of respiratory diphtheria caused by toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ of P1 and their mother. Whole-genome sequencing results show similarity of the outbreak isolates with isolates from people experiencing homelessness in Germany in 2023 and 2024 as well as from newly arriving migrants linked to the international outbreak in 2022.

Methods
-------
Outbreak case definition:
------
As a confirmed case, we defined any person with laboratory-confirmed toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ and an epidemiological link to the index case (P1).

Microbiological and molecular investigations:
------
Toxigenicity testing at the GNCLD was done by real-time PCR [6], lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) [7] and an optimized Elek test [8] using methods as described previously.

Further microbiological analyses included biochemical differentiation (API Coryne, Biomerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS, MALDI Biotyper; Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, the United States (USA)) using methods as described previously [9]. Antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing of the isolate was performed on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5% lysed horse blood and 20 mg/L beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) (MH-F agar) by agar diffusion test and read after 18 ± 2 hours incubation at 35 ± deg C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Disc diffusion diameters were determined according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines for _C. diphtheriae_ [10].

Whole-genome sequencing was carried out after DNA extraction with Beckman Coulter Genfind V3 kit (Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA), using library preparation with the Illumina DNA prep kit and Illumina paired-end next generation sequencing (NGS) (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on 7 housekeeping loci [11] and core genome (cg) MLST analysis based on a scheme of 1553 _C. diphtheriae_-specific target loci [12] were carried out with the NGS data using Ridom SeqSpehre + software (Ridom GmbH, Munster, Germany).

Epidemiological investigations:
------
The responsible local public health authorities initiated public health measures including contact tracing and throat swab sampling from household members and other close contacts following German national recommendations [5]. Further, epidemiological investigations included the matching of laboratory isolates with cases notified under the German Infection Protection Act to consolidate case information from epidemiological investigations.

Results
--------
Outbreak investigations resulted in the detection of an additional case with an epidemiological link to P1, i.e., the child's mother (P2). Furthermore, molecular analyses suggest possible links to other diphtheria cases among vulnerable groups, namely people experiencing homelessness and newly arriving migrants in Germany.

Microbiological results:
------
The isolates KL3499 (P1) and KL3502 (P2) were both tested toxigenic by the 3 methods mentioned above [6-8] and identified as _C. diphtheriae_ biovar mitis by biochemical differentiation (API Coryne code 1010324) and MALDI-TOF analysis [9]. Both isolates were sensitive to penicillin G (susceptible, increased exposure), meropenem, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, rifampicin, linezolid, and ciprofloxacin (susceptible, increased exposure), but resistant against cotrimoxazole [10].

Epidemiological and molecular findings:
------
Epidemiological investigations found that P1 had no history of travel abroad and no contact to known diphtheria cases. P2 worked in childcare, fell ill with pharyngitis 9 days before P1 became ill, and was on sick leave for 5 days. At that point, a throat swab arranged by a general practitioner was only examined for streptococci and tested negative. The pharyngeal swab obtained during contact tracing by the local public health authority, 2 days after hospital admission of P1, was positive for _C. diphtheriae_. The isolate (KL3502) was identified as toxigenic and exhibited the same antimicrobial resistance profile as the isolate of P1 after being sent to the GNCLD for further analysis and characterization. P2 had received the complete set of vaccine doses according to the latest German vaccination recommendations [3], including a 3-dose primary series of diphtheria-containing vaccine followed by booster doses, although the most recent booster vaccination was in 2010, i.e., not up to date anymore. P2 had no history of traveling abroad, no contacts to known diphtheria cases, people experiencing homelessness, or migrants newly arriving in Germany before her pharyngitis.

For further outbreak investigation, a NGS data analysis was performed comparing both _C. diphtheriae_ isolates (KL3499 and KL3502) of P1 and P2, respectively. Classical MLST based on 7 housekeeping loci [11], extracted from the WGS data yielded sequence type (ST) 574. This ST was first detected in Germany in 2022 among migrants arriving in Germany [12]. It had been designated in the pubMLST database (<https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/diphtheria/>) in December 2021 in a sample from India. Core genome MLST [12] revealed only one allele distance (AD) between the 2 isolates, thereby confirming clonality (Figure).

Both isolates showed close genetic relationship (10-16 AD) to a cluster of the same ST 574 from the 2022 European diphtheria outbreak among migrants [12-14]. Noteworthy, the isolate from P1 showed very few AD to isolates from other recent diphtheria cases in Germany. It had an AD of only 3-4 to 4 recent isolates (KL3144, KL3195, KL3488, KL3493) of cutaneous diphtheria among people experiencing homelessness (P3-P6) from the same metropolitan area where P1 and P2 attended school and work (Table [for tables/figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). In addition, it had an AD of 15-17 to an additional sub-cluster of persons experiencing homelessness from the metropolitan area of Frankfurt am Main in the federal state of Hesse [15] (Figure). In the Supplemental Table, cgMLST-derived AD of all analysed isolates to P1 are presented. P2 showed one more allele distance than P1 to the other isolates.

Patients P3-P6 had deep wound infections. Isolates of _C. diphtheriae_ from the wounds were sent to the GNCLD between January and September 2024. All isolates were toxigenic and cotrimoxazole-resistant, as the isolates KL3499 and KL3502 from P1 and P2 (Table).

Outbreak control measures
-----------------
Public health measures around the outbreak focused on contact tracing. Nine household members received post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) consisting of azithromycin or erythromycin. The local public health authority responsible for the school of P1 and workplace of P2 arranged swab taking and recommended administration of PEP for all close contacts of P1 at school and of P2 at work. All close contacts of P1 and P2 and their household members tested negative for _C. diphtheriae_. No secondary case was detected.

Discussion
----------
Diphtheria outbreaks occur rarely in Germany. The last autochthonous respiratory diphtheria outbreak was reported in the town of Wuppertal between 1982 and 1984 [16]. In 2018, an outbreak comprising 2 siblings with imported cutaneous diphtheria caused by _C. diphtheriae_ was reported [17]. In summer 2022, German public health authorities observed an increase of notified diphtheria cases caused by _C. diphtheriae_ associated with the European-wide outbreak among people seeking asylum [12-14]. In line with the fact that _C. diphtheriae_ cases are often travel-associated, both outbreaks exclusively described patients with imported diphtheria and no secondary cases were identified in Germany but the second sibling [17]. In October 2023, an outbreak investigation among people experiencing homelessness in a German city documented community transmission of cutaneous diphtheria caused by toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ [15] for the first time, in contrast to previously seen cases of non-toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ in a similar population [18].

The new outbreak described here presents the first established autochthonous outbreak of respiratory diphtheria caused by toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_, possibly linked to transmission among people experiencing homelessness in other German cities or migrants with imported diphtheria. The results of the outbreak investigation have several implications and consequences for public health measures.

Sequencing (WGS) confirmed the autochthonous diphtheria outbreak with 1 AD between the isolates of P1 and P2 and allowed the identification of just a few AD from the isolates of P1, P2, and P3-P6 among people experiencing homelessness, thus suggesting a possible link. The isolates of P1-P6 were typed as ST 574, an ST not detected in Germany before 2022. However, as during the pan-European outbreak, a cluster developed within this ST. Thereby, ST 574 isolates make up 27% of the European entries within the pubMLST database (292 out of 1077 as of 23 Apr 2025). However, as uploading to the pubMLST database is not mandatory, and outbreak isolates are more likely to be uploaded due to public health interest than sporadic isolates, this percentage may be biased.

During the outbreak investigation of the 2022-2023 diphtheria cases imported to Germany, no secondary cases among the wider population could be identified. However, WGS results highlight the possible link of imported diphtheria cases with community transmission among people experiencing homelessness and the described respiratory diphtheria outbreak [15]. Although there are no hard thresholds for the number of AD with which isolates are assigned to a cluster or not, previous studies have shown that allelic and SNP distances are usually in a similar range [18]. A relationship can be assumed for distances, such as those between the isolates of the main node of the cluster and especially within the subcluster of isolates of the same region, [12,14,15,19,20]. For the specific cgMLST scheme used in this study [18], we applied an empirical cluster threshold of 14. Taking these facts and an estimated substitution size of 1.67 x 10^-6 per site and year into account [21], the small (3-4) to medium (10-16) AD in the minimum spanning tree (MST) indicate of persistent transmission over the timespan of approximately 2 years, considering an expansion from the main node of the MST. In the absence of clear epidemiological links, however, direct correlations could not be established. However, the phylogeny cannot give the complete picture, and isolates, particularly from vulnerable groups such as people experiencing homelessness and from vaccinated persons with asymptomatic or sub-clinical (mild) respiratory diphtheria, might be missing. The analysis shows, however, that _C. diphtheriae_ transmission occurs in different geographic areas and poses a risk to different groups vulnerable because of barriers to accessing healthcare, such as migrants, people experiencing homelessness and all unvaccinated individuals.

Notably, a similar finding was reported from Basel, Switzerland: 2 genetically identical strains of ST 574 from 2 over 70-years-old adults showed only 6-16 AD to a cluster of strains obtained in 2022 from a federal asylum centre in the same area, with no epidemiological links between the 2 patients or the migrant population [19]. This underlines the importance of ensuring early and timely diagnosis of imported diphtheria to prevent further transmission. For instance, as part of initial medical examinations, newly arriving migrants with skin lesions should be routinely tested for _Corynebacterium_ spp. and receive, if necessary, antimicrobial treatment and instructions on infection prevention to avoid further transmission [13,22].

Furthermore, it is essential to consider that the number of unreported cases is not known and that both groups -- newly arriving migrants and people experiencing homelessness -- are not mutually exclusive. For a variety of reasons, migrants might experience homelessness. Thus, additional active case finding among people experiencing homelessness in the cities linked to the outbreak of mainly cutaneous diphtheria among newly arriving migrants across several European countries [12-14] could ensure detection of undiagnosed diphtheria cases or pathogen carriage and adequate treatment. At the same time, offering vaccination checks and services contributes to the protection of individuals as well as the community. Given the vulnerabilities of the aforementioned groups, such as barriers to access healthcare, vaccination services should be part of any medical outreach [23].

The 2 outbreak cases lived in relative geographic proximity to the location of the genetically closely linked cutaneous diphtheria cases. Nevertheless, despite extensive case finding, this outbreak investigation could not establish an epidemiological link between the respiratory cases and cutaneous cases among people experiencing homelessness. Neither P1 nor P2 reported any contact to people experiencing homelessness or newly-arriving migrants.

Although the isolate from P1 seems to be genetically closer related to the diphtheria cases among people experiencing homelessness than P2, the timeline of symptom onset with the P2's symptoms appearing 9 days before P1's may indicate transmission from mother to child. The clinical course suggests that P2 might have had a less severe form of respiratory diphtheria because of her vaccinations and thus unconsciously passed the pathogen to P1. This is also in line with longer unusual but observed incubation periods beyond 5 days. But since the swab from P2 was taken 2 days after hospital admission of P1, it is also possible that P2 was colonized through the contact with P1. However, it cannot be completely ruled out that P1 was infected first and transmitted _C. diphtheriae_ to P2, who then displayed respiratory colonisation with _C. diphtheriae_. As discussed above, the phylogeny does not include all possible isolates, as a certain number of cases may neither be reported nor analyzed. Hence, it can be assumed that transmission has taken place, but the discussed options are the most likely of several possibilities of how the pathogen may have spread.

P1 and P2 had respiratory diphtheria while the patients with the genetically closest isolates and living in the geographically nearest area to them had cutaneous diphtheria. The common understanding is that cases of cutaneous diphtheria lead to cutaneous diphtheria in other persons via direct or indirect contact transmission. However, the findings here show that it might be possible that cutaneous diphtheria leads to respiratory diphtheria. Double manifestations may play a role as some migrants in the 2022 outbreak had cutaneous diphtheria combined with colonisation of the respiratory tract or mild respiratory symptoms [12]. This stresses the need to ensure adequate protection for people with high risk of exposure to cutaneous diphtheria such as people living or working in shelters or asylum reception centres.

In a world connected by travel, migration, and other forms of person movements, pathogens causing vaccine-preventable diseases can be imported at any time. If vaccination coverage levels in the population are inadequately low, this can pose a risk, particularly to un- or undervaccinated individuals. Therefore, providing access to vaccinations, debunking misinformation, addressing causes of low vaccine acceptance and skepticism to ensure high vaccine uptake is of utmost importance to protect individuals and communities. The best protection against diphtheria is the diphtheria toxoid vaccine based on the diphtheria toxin of _C. diphtheriae_.

Marginalized groups such as migrants and people experiencing homelessness often have restricted access to health services, resulting in low vaccination coverage. Therefore, it is essential to ensure free and timely access to vaccination services, e.g., by offering vaccination for all migrants or asylum-seekers upon arrival in Germany, as formally guaranteed by the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act, or by conducting targeted booster vaccination campaigns for people experiencing homelessness.

In addition, routine vaccination efforts should be intensified, e.g., during the school entry examinations for children or through health check-ups for adults. Although vaccination levels in Germany are higher for school-aged children (89% at the age of 6 years), timeliness of vaccination is a concern, leaving many young children at risk [4]. Only 64% of German children have received 3 doses by the age of 15 months, and only 77% are fully immunized against diphtheria by 24 months [4]. In adults, only 53% have received a booster vaccination within the last 10 years [24]. Similarly, anti-diphtheria seroprotection rates have been shown to decrease, especially in older age groups in many European countries [24-27]. Given the increasing life expectancy worldwide the need for booster doses should be evaluated in the long term [28].

Conclusion
---------
The most important measure for controlling-diphtheria and preventing outbreaks remains high coverage with a diphtheria targeting vaccine in all population groups. Moreover, adequate surveillance systems with laboratory diagnostic capacity are necessary to ensure the detection of people with diphtheria, particularly to identify and respond to autochthonous transmission. Outbreaks, like the one described here, should be a reminder of the importance of vaccines in preventing morbidity and mortality resulting from vaccine-preventable diseases -- even those that were long deemed forgotten and disappearing.

El sarampión avanza de manera acelerada en el país, de un día a otro, se registraron casi 50 casos más. Hasta el 8 de julio, la Secretaría de Salud confirmó 3 mil 171 casos acumulados en México; en las últimas 24 horas se reportaron 47 nuevos contagios de sarampión.

Actualmente, son 20 estados de la república los afectados y ante el periodo vacacional se prevé que los casos se disparen.

El secretario de Salud en Jalisco, Héctor Raúl Pérez Gómez, señaló que se han hecho esfuerzos para recuperar la vacunación en la población infantil, sin embargo no es suficiente, ya que la Organización Mundial de la Salud recomienda una protección del 95 por ciento, cuando en el estado el porcentaje es mucho menor: 

“Fíjate que estamos en el 89 por ciento lo cual es bueno, pero quisiéramos estar ya arriba del 90 por ciento, yo invitaría a la población a que sigan visualizando cómo está su esquema de vacunación sobre todo de sarampión, rubéola y paperas por el brote de sarampión que hay en méxico”.

La mayoría de los casos de sarampión se encuentran en Chihuahua con 2 mil 966 casos acumulados y 8 muertes, Sinaloa se ubica en el segundo sitio con 83 enfermos y una muerte, los otros estados son Zacatecas, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Durango, Campeche, Michoacán, entre otros. 

En cuanto al número de casos, el principal grupo de edad afectado es de 0 a 4 años de edad con 664 casos, seguido de 25 a 29 años, y el de 30 a 34 años. La mayoría no estaban vacunados.

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has embarked on an emergency measles vaccination campaign in Zurmi Local Government Area (LGA), where an outbreak has killed 24 children.

The international humanitarian agency is running the campaign in collaboration with the Zamfara State Ministry of Health, Abdullahi Ali, its head of mission, disclosed in a statement on Tuesday [8 Jul 2025].

Reports said most of the victims of the disease outbreak were unvaccinated children under 5 years of age.

The 6-day campaign, which began on Tuesday [8 Jul 2024], targets children between 6 months and 5 years old. An official said the goal is to stop the spread of measles quickly and prevent more deaths.

The MSF team is also screening children during the campaign for signs of malnutrition, using a simple arm measurement (MUAC), with undernourished individuals referred to nearby health centres for treatment.

Mr Ali said the emergency measure was prompted by over 1600 suspected measles cases reported across the 11 wards in Zurmi since early May [2025]. He said the cases far exceed the epidemic threshold.

Furthermore, he said the current death rate stands at 1.2%, with many of the severely ill children also battling other health complications such as eye infections, malaria, and, significantly, malnutrition.

Describing the devastating impact, the MSF official said: ""Children in Zurmi are facing a double crisis of disease and hunger. We are seeing a sharp rise in measles cases, along with high levels of malnutrition, which makes children even more vulnerable.""

Mr Ali noted that a nutrition screening conducted in June 2024 showed that over 1 in 4 children in Zurmi were undernourished, with more than 4% suffering from severe malnutrition. This figure, he said, is well above emergency levels set by the World Health Organisation, noting that the MSF-run treatment centre at Zurmi General Hospital was admitting an increasing number of children with severe nutrition-related complications.

""To reach as many children as possible, MSF is using both fixed vaccination sites and mobile teams that can travel to remote and hard-to-reach areas. The aim is to vaccinate at least 95% of children in the target age group to protect the wider community and stop the outbreak,"" Mr Ali said.

""A previous vaccination campaign in June 2024 only reached 59% of children due to a shortage of vaccines and security issues in some areas,"" the official said.

Mr Ali said the current outbreak is particularly severe in communities such as Zurmi town, Dauran Birnin Tsaba, Mayasa Kuturu, and Rukudawa, where regular vaccination services are limited and access to healthcare remains difficult.

MSF appealed to all partners and health authorities to support this urgent response and help ensure that every child in Zurmi gets the care and protection they need.

The Free State Department of Health has issued an urgent public health alert following a confirmed measles outbreak in the Lejweleputswa District, specifically affecting Nala (Bothaville) and surrounding municipalities including Masilonyana, Matjhabeng, and Tswelopele.

According to provincial health spokesperson Mondli Mvambi, a total of 64 cases of the highly contagious viral infection have been reported, with the most affected group being children aged 5 to 9 years. Health officials are calling for immediate community awareness and vaccination action to prevent further spread.

""Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that can lead to serious health complications. It is crucial for parents and guardians to be vigilant and aware of the symptoms,"" Mvambi said.

Symptoms of measles to watch out for:
- Fever
- Runny nose
- Cough
- Red eyes (conjunctivitis)
- General fatigue
- Red rash (typically starting on the face and spreading to the body)

Health department's appeal: vaccinate to protect
------
Mvambi strongly encouraged all parents and caregivers to ensure their children are up-to-date with their measles vaccinations, describing the vaccine as both safe and effective.

""We urge all parents to ensure that their children are vaccinated against measles. The measles vaccine is safe and effective and is the best way to protect your child and the community from this disease,"" he said.

The department is actively deploying response teams to the affected areas to monitor cases, support local clinics, and assist with vaccination drives.

Public safety measures and action steps for parents
------
The Department of Health recommends the following:
- Monitor children for any symptoms listed above, especially fever and rash.
- Visit your healthcare provider immediately if symptoms develop.
- Confirm your child's vaccination status with your clinic or healthcare provider.
- Encourage others in your community to vaccinate their children and be alert to symptoms.
- Practice good hygiene, including regular handwashing and avoiding contact with infected individuals.

Community support is critical
------
The outbreak comes amid ongoing efforts to strengthen childhood immunisation in the province. Health officials have reiterated that measles can be deadly if not addressed early, particularly in young children and those with weakened immune systems.

""Your health and the health of our community are our top priorities. Together, we can prevent the spread of measles and protect our children,"" said Mvambi.

Need help or information?
------
Residents are encouraged to visit their nearest clinic for more information or to check their child's vaccination records. Clinics across the affected municipalities have been briefed to respond promptly to suspected cases and to assist with community education.

Background on measles
------
Measles is caused by a virus that spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or close contact with infected individuals. It is one of the most contagious diseases but can be completely prevented with 2 doses of the measles vaccine, typically administered during early childhood.

Affected areas in Free State:
------
- Nala (Bothaville)
- Masilonyana (Brandfort, Theunissen)
- Matjhabeng (Welkom, Odendaalsrus)
- Tswelopele (Hoopstad, Bultfontein)

Measles outbreak: child dies in Liverpool as vaccine rate plunges
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A child has died after contracting measles amid public health warnings about the dangers of declining MMR vaccination rates.

The child died in Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, a city in the grip of an outbreak of the disease. They were in the intensive care unit and, while no details have been released about their care, it is understood they were severely ill with measles as well as other serious health problems.

The child is the second to have succumbed to an acute measles infection in Britain this decade. Their age and gender are not known, but they were 1 of 17 youngsters treated at the hospital in recent weeks after becoming severely unwell with measles.

Infections are increasing across Britain as low vaccination rates leave children vulnerable to the virus. It is not known whether the child who died had been vaccinated, but experts said that the jab provided 97% protection against getting ill.

The MMR vaccination uptake rate for children by the age of 5 in Liverpool is just 73%, significantly lower than the average across the northwest, 86%, and the whole of England at 84%. It is the lowest uptake outside of London. The WHO says a threshold of 95% is needed to achieve herd immunity.

The number of children being treated at Alder Hey has public health officials worried that the virus could take hold in the city and ""spread like wildfire"". The number could mean there are more infections than are officially reported and suggests Merseyside is on the cusp of a significant large-scale outbreak.

Measles is highly contagious. An infected person remains infectious for up to 10 days and could spread the virus to 15 people. With Liverpool's low vaccine uptake, this could mean approximately 288 people in every 1000 across the region are at risk.

Last week, public health officials wrote an open letter to parents in the region, urging them to get their children vaccinated. Professor Matt Ashton, director of public health for Liverpool, said: ""I'm extremely worried that the potential is there for measles to really grab hold in our community. My concern is the unprotected population and it [the virus] spreading like wildfire.

""That's why we're trying to be proactive. It's really important that people understand the seriousness of this. We're not in a large-scale outbreak situation at the moment but what we are seeing is sporadic cases popping up more and more frequently, to the point where Alder Hey is really worried about the people presenting at the front door and needing treatment."" Ashton...said more needed to be done to make it easier for people to get the jabs.

Alder Hey Hospital, the local NHS and public health teams in Liverpool and Merseyside are co-ordinating a response to the increase in measles cases, trying to alert families to the risks and help parents get their children vaccinated.

As part of this, Alder Hey has begun vaccinating children in its A&E department who may have missed out on the jab and are being treated for other reasons. Its experts are drawing up advice for other hospitals to follow its lead in responding to rising cases. Across Merseyside a series of summer catch-up vaccination clinics have been organised, as well as a public health bus that will go out into communities.

Rachel Isba, a consultant in pediatric public health medicine at Alder Hey, said sufferers needing hospital treatment was a ""canary in the coalmine as to what's going on in the community"". She feared that many more cases are going unreported. ""It's concerning that [patients] are so unwell they require hospital treatment,"" she said. ""What's happening during this episode is that more of them are more unwell and needing more treatment in hospital, which for me, doing this for more than 20 years, stands out. I think it is why Alder Hey has sounded the alarm, because it is so serious.""

Alberta's measles outbreaks surpass case counts reported for entire USA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Alberta has now confirmed more measles cases than the entire United States has reported in 2025. The province has been battling outbreaks since March and as of noon Monday [14 Jul 2025], total case counts in the province had ballooned to 1314. The latest update from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that country has amassed 1288 cases this year.

""Looking at the numbers it saddens me,"" said Dr. Sam Wong, the president of the section of pediatrics with the Alberta Medical Association. ""I think if we had gotten to it sooner -- and taken it more seriously sooner -- then maybe we would not have reached this milestone where one province actually exceeds the entire case count for the United States, which has got 10 times the population as Canada.""

Thirty new cases were reported between midday Friday [11 Jul 2025] and noon Monday [14 Jul 2025].

""It's absolutely terrible,"" said Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious diseases specialist with the University of Alberta. ""It is really a massive scale of spread that's going on right now.""

It is widely believed by experts and health officials that Alberta's case counts are higher than the confirmed numbers reflect. A standing exposure advisory remains in effect for the entire south zone and parts of the north due to widespread transmission. And the Alberta government's measles website says cases are likely going unreported and undetected.

Saxinger worries about the impact of large summer gatherings such as the Calgary Stampede, which just ended on Sunday [13 Jul 2025]. ""I don't think we've seen a suggestion of things levelling off and now there's large meetings of people and after that school will be back in. So I think there's still a period of serious vulnerability to increasing numbers for a while,"" said Saxinger. ""As an infectious diseases specialist I never would have guessed this was going to happen because measles is supposed to be eradicated.""

The south, north and central health zones have been the hardest hit by outbreaks. According to provincial data, there had been 102 hospitalizations, including 15 ICU admissions, as of July 5 [2025]. No deaths have been reported. The latest national statistics show 58% of the new cases reported during the week of June 22-28 were in Alberta.

""We know that per capita we have more measles cases in Alberta than really anywhere else in North America,"" said Craig Jenne, a professor in the department of microbiology, immunology and infectious diseases at the University of Calgary. ""We have heard stories that there may be underreporting in the United States but even the fact that we're close to those numbers is quite concerning given we have almost a hundredth the population.""

The latest case breakdown shows there have been a total of 774 cases in the south zone, 35 in Calgary zone, 107 in central zone, 13 in the Edmonton zone and 385 in the north.

""Perhaps the more concerning aspect, at least for me, is not the total number of cases, it's how quickly we've gotten here,"" said Jenne, who is also the deputy director of the Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases.

Alberta's measles outbreaks have snowballed more quickly than Ontario's, which started in October [2024], according to Jenne. That province, which has 3 times the population of Alberta, had confirmed 1934 as of July 8 [2025], with another 310 probable cases.

Measles is highly contagious and can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, brain inflammation, premature delivery and even death. Young children, pregnant individuals and those with weakened immune systems are at highest risk.

""I'm really afraid that we're going to see terrible outcomes in babies and kids under 5 because that's the most vulnerable group across the board,"" said Saxinger. She's calling on the provincial government to take key steps to rein in the outbreak, including setting up mass vaccination clinics and campaigns. ""I think there can be a lot of unintended barriers for people who even want to get their vaccines updated.... It can be really hard to book actually getting it,"" she said.

Saxinger also wants the province to target school-aged children for vaccination before they head back to school in the fall. And, like other physicians, Saxinger is calling on the province to offer an early and extra vaccine dose to babies as young as 6 months old in all regions. The extra shot is only being offered in the south, central and north zones.

Pregnant Albertans, who are at high risk as well, need to know they should seek help if they've potentially been exposed, according to Saxinger, and vaccine messaging in general needs to be improved. ""I think it really has to be a big priority for elected officials to remind people, because not everyone watches the news [and] not everyone gets the same information.""

The Alberta government is defending its measles response, saying it's working to limit further spread and support those impacted. ""Expanded vaccination clinics, targeted outreach, and clear public health guidance are already in place and showing positive results,"" an emailed statement from the Ministry of Primary and Preventative Health Services read in part. Measles clinics hours and locations have been expanded in higher risk areas, according to the spokesperson, particularly in southern Alberta.

""As of now, there are 2 [Alberta] patients in hospital, and at no point have more than 3 or 4 patients been hospitalized at once,"" the Alberta government spokesperson said. ""There are currently 13 active cases across the province, and that number has remained stable for several weeks. Three of the 5 health zones have not seen any significant recent increase in cases. Weekly case numbers have now declined for 4 consecutive weeks and are roughly half of what they were at the recent peak.""

The Alberta government's own website explains the ""active"" case count is an estimate and does not reflect the risk level because it doesn't account for those who are undiagnosed or who have been exposed. The Alberta government has also extended its Don't Get Measles, Get Immunized ad campaign into mid-August [2025] and public health teams are calling parents of young babies in the hardest-hit zones to let them know their infants are eligible for an early vaccine dose. The ministry said its efforts are working and between mid-March and early June, the number of vaccine doses administered across Alberta increased by 57%.

State of São Paulo registers 90% increase in cases of hepatitis A in 2025
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The state of São Paulo registered 949 cases of hepatitis A in the first half of 2025, against 498 in the same period of 2024. Data from the State Health Department (SES) reveal an increase of 90.5%. The capital of São Paulo alone concentrated 476 cases of the disease between January 1 and July 2, 2025, according to the Municipal Health Department.

Vaccination is the main form of prevention against the disease. Available for free through the Unified Health System, one-dose immunization is recommended for children at 15 months, but can be applied up to 5 years of age. The 2-dose schedule is recommended for people with liver diseases, chronic carriers of hepatitis B, people with HIV or using HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), immunosuppressive diseases, and in addition to transplant patients.

In the capital, 4543 doses of the vaccine in adults were applied from January to June 2024. The number increased to 9487 in the same period in 2025 -- an increase of 108.8%. However, vaccination in children suffered a drop of 9.7% in the city of São Paulo. In the first half of 2025, 55 160 doses were administered, compared to 61 085 last year [2024].

In a note, the SES informed that ""it continuously follows and monitors the cases of hepatitis A registered in the state. The Ministry, in partnership with the 645 municipalities of São Paulo, has been carrying out training actions for health professionals and testing for the population to detect the disease.""

According to the city hall, the main measures to prevent hepatitis A are:
- Wash hands (after using the toilet, changing diapers and before preparing food);
- Wash food consumed raw with treated, chlorinated or boiled water, leaving it to soak for 30 minutes;
- Cook food well before consumption, especially shellfish, seafood and fish;
- Properly sanitize plates, glasses, cutlery and bottles;
- Use adequate sanitary facilities;
- In places such as daycare centers, schools, cafeterias, restaurants and closed institutions, adopt strict hygiene measures, such as disinfecting surfaces with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite or bleach;
- Avoid bathing and playing in ditches, streams, fountains, flood areas or near sewage;
- Avoid the construction of cesspools near wells and springs;
- Use condoms and perform hygiene of the genital, perineum and anal regions before and after sexual intercourse.

Japan's pertussis epidemic hits a 7-year high
---------------------------------------------

The whooping cough epidemic in Japan continues to spread. Lin Shibi, a Japanese travel expert and former infectious disease physician at National Taiwan University Hospital, warned that the recent epidemic in Japan has reached its peak. Although adults are unlikely to die or have complications, infants under 6 months old may have severe symptoms. People traveling to Japan should pay special attention.

Lin Shibi posted on Facebook that the whooping cough epidemic in Japan is reaching its peak and is the most prevalent since 2018. The number of confirmed cases since the end of June this year [2025] has exceeded 39 672, more than 4 times that of last year [2024]. Unlike the new coronavirus and influenza, whooping cough will not cause death or complications in adults or children, but infants under 6 months old may develop serious illnesses such as pneumonia, encephalitis, convulsions, hypoxic encephalopathy, and even death.

Lin said that the mortality rate of whooping cough in infants under 6 months old is 1%-3%, and called for not taking infants to infected areas. If you want to take infants, it is recommended to take all 4 doses of vaccine within 18 months before going to epidemic areas. He added that the incubation period of whooping cough is 7 to 10 days, which is a long incubation period. Usually the disease will not occur during travel, but more often after returning home, so there is no need to worry about seeking medical treatment in Japan.

Pediatrician Dr. Jaden also posted on Facebook to remind the public of the symptoms of whooping cough. The initial symptoms of the patient are similar to those of a cold, with runny nose and cough, but after 1 to 2 weeks, paroxysmal severe coughing will occur, and the patient will cough until blushing, red ears, red eyes, and even vomiting occur. If not properly treated, it may last for 2 to 3 months, and in severe cases, the patient may even ""cough to the point of breaking ribs.""

Dr. Jaden also pointed out that the younger the age, the more severe the symptoms, especially for infants under 1 year old. The risk is very high. In severe cases, it may lead to serious complications such as respiratory arrest or pneumonia.

It is mainly transmitted through droplets and is highly contagious. If a child has a persistent cough, coughs to the point of being unable to sleep, and has difficulty breathing, they may have whooping cough. If you plan to travel to Japan, you need to be especially careful.

Screening study for hepatitis B and hepatitis D demonstrates need for follow-up testing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first USA study which looked at hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis D (HDV) prevalence concurrently found that nearly one in 3 (28%) HBV-positive specimens were also HDV positive. The study's results were published in the Journal of Viral Hepatitis [see citation below].

""We looked at over 5200 specimens across the USA, about 2.2% of those were positive for hepatitis D antibodies,"" said study first author Elizabeth Marlowe, PhD, D (ABMM), executive scientific director of Infectious Diseases for Quest Diagnostics. ""Now the algorithm is if the antibody is positive, you then want to run a PCR to look for RNA, which means you have active infection. And of those, about 28% of those were positive for RNA.""

The study investigators looked at deidentified remnant HBsAg-positive specimens submitted for routine clinical testing to Quest, and represented all 10 Health and Human Services (HHS) regions. Females made up 45% of the participants, and the mean ages were 50.8 (male) and 49.4 (female) years. Reflex testing of HBsAg-positive specimens for HDV antibody testing, and further testing of positive specimens for HDV RNA, were conducted from July 2023 to June 2024.

As the study looked at prevalence by HHS region, one interesting finding was that the highest absolute number of HDV Ab-positive specimens [was] in HHS region 9 (which includes California, Nevada, Arizona).

HDV is concerning because of its ability to progress to more serious complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Having HDV leads to a faster progression [of liver disease than HBV alone].

""Given the serious nature of the disease, universal testing of HBsAg-positive specimens followed by reflex HDV RNA would increase our understanding of HDV prevalence, allow for earlier identification and linkage to care and benefit patients with previously unrecognized HDV infection,"" the Journal of Viral Hepatitis investigators wrote.

Marlowe mentions updated screening guidelines that are expected to come out soon, and why, in testing for HBV, HDV testing should be considered.

Mississippi health officials warn of rising pertussis cases
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Mississippi State Department of Health has issued a health alert due to a rise in pertussis cases, with 80 reported so far in 2025 compared to 49 in all of 2024. Also known as whooping cough, pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease that causes uncontrollable, violent coughs that make it hard to breathe. It most commonly affects infants and young children and can be fatal, especially in babies younger than 1 year old.

Most (76%) of this year's [2025] cases have occurred in children younger than 18 years of age, including 7 cases in infants younger than 2 months old. Of the 73 cases that were age-eligible for pertussis vaccination, 28 were not vaccinated. Among those unvaccinated, 23 were younger than 18 years old. Of the 10 hospitalized, 7 were children younger than 2 years old. While cases have been reported statewide, 40% were identified in Northeast Mississippi.

State health officials recommend vaccination, which is one of the safest and most effective ways to protect against pertussis. There are 2 types of combination vaccines that include protection against pertussis, as well as diphtheria and tetanus: DTaP and Tdap. DTaP is recommended for younger children, while Tdap is recommended for older children, pregnant women and adults.

MSDH officials said vaccine hesitancy could be a contributing factor in the jump in cases. Mississippi used to have the highest child vaccination in the nation, but it dropped to No. 3 after a 2023 federal court order forced the state to allow thousands of parents to opt out of required vaccinations based on religious exemptions. With fall school classes starting as early as next week, there's a growing fear that the number of cases could go even higher.

""Yes, we are concerned because kids are congregating again,"" said state epidemiologist Dr. Renia Dotson. ""If you have students come back with pertussis, or whooping cough, then certainly that can cause an outbreak, and students who are not vaccinated, and also individuals who have waning immune status. So yes, the overall gathering and congregating in spaces is certainly concerning.""

Pertussis is transmitted person-to-person through respiratory droplets or contact with airborne droplets. Patients are considered infectious from the onset of symptoms until 3 weeks after the start of high-pitched coughing fits, or until completing 5 days of antibiotics. Recommended treatment includes antimicrobials within 3 weeks of cough onset in people 1 year of age and older, and within 6 weeks of cough onset in infants younger than 1 year old and pregnant women.

Confirmed 6 cases of whooping cough in children and teens under the age of 19 in Haywood County
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Wednesday [9 Jul 2025], Haywood County Health and Human Services confirmed 5 cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, in children and teens under the age of 19 in Haywood County. On Friday [11 Jul 2025], officials in Haywood County, North Carolina, confirmed an additional case of whooping cough. Two of those individuals have been hospitalized.

""We are seeing isolated cases in Haywood County, and we want our residents to understand that pertussis is here, and we need to be cautious,"" said Dr. Sarah Banks, Haywood County public health director. ""The increase in cases is an important reminder that vaccination is the single most effective way to prevent pertussis and reduce the severity of the disease.""

Whooping cough is a serious illness that spreads easily when people cough or sneeze. It causes strong coughing fits that can make it hard to breathe, eat, or sleep. It is especially dangerous for babies, pregnant women, and people with weak immune systems.

Common symptoms of whooping cough:
- Long or severe coughing fits
- A ""whooping"" sound when breathing in after a cough
- Vomiting after coughing
- Runny nose or stuffy nose
- Mild fever (or no fever at all)

How to protect yourself and others: Get vaccinated. Health officials say vaccines are the best way to prevent whooping cough.

Here's what the CDC recommends:
- Babies and young children should get shots at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months, and again at 4-6 years
- Pre-teens should get a booster shot around age 11 or 12
- Adults should get a Tdap booster if they haven't had one
- Pregnant women should get a Tdap shot during each pregnancy (between 27-36 weeks)

Stay home when sick: If you or your child has a cough or other symptoms, stay home from work, school, or daycare to avoid spreading it.

Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands often and cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing.

Somalia: Hepatitis rate at alarming level
-----------------------------------------
The Somali government has issued a warning about the increasing rate of hepatitis in the country, which it described as ""alarming"" according to Somali Health Minister Dr. Ali Haji Aden, who was quoted by state media.

""The data from the Greenpeace are very shocking and alarming. It is important that testing is prioritized. If students are in school, they should be tested at health centers. People working in homes should be tested,"" said Minister Ali.

He added that it is important to unify data across the country, and plans are underway to implement a digital system through which public and private institutions can submit data to make it easier to conduct research and monitor the data.

""We pledge to work together to eradicate these efforts,"" he added.

The Somali Minister of Health added that hepatitis is more dangerous in terms of spread than HIV/AIDS, and efforts are needed to combat it.

The world aims to eliminate Hepatitis by 2030.

What is hepatitis?
------------------
Hepatitis is a term used by Somalis to describe a symptom of a virus that infects the liver, known as Hepatitis, which has various types. In some Somali regions, it is called Jonis.

These names were given to the symptoms of the disease.

Dr Mohamed Hamud, a general practitioner in the UK, told the BBC that this disease is dangerous in terms of its spread.

The rise of disease in Somalia
------------------------------
As Dr. Mohamed Hamud told the BBC, research conducted among Somalis living in the Horn of Africa shows that 20% are living with Hepatitis.

Dr. Xamud noted that given the current state of the disease, it is something to be concerned about and do something about.

Dr. Mohamed said the main reasons for the spread and increase of this disease in Somalis are the low level of healthcare and vaccination.

He added that the disease has spread rapidly in Somalia, making it easier for it to spread.

Ways of transmitting Hepatitis
------------------------------
This disease is basically caused by several different viruses, classified as Hepatitis, A, B, C, D, and E, the 2 most serious being B and C, which cause liver damage.

Dr. Mohamed Xaamud told the BBC about the ways in which hepatitis or jaundice is transmitted, including:
- Sex
- Transfused blood
- A needle that has been used by an infected person and has not been injected by anyone else
- A pregnant mother passes it on to her child.

These methods are among the most common, although there are also other ways of transmission as medical studies indicate.

How to prevent Hepatitis
------------------------
As Dr. Mohamed Xaamud told the BBC, fortunately, Hepatitis B has a vaccine and there is a need to increase public awareness of the disease.

He added that young children should be vaccinated, and couples should be screened as a precaution.

Hepatitis is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world, especially in developing countries with low health standards.

According to health studies, Hepatitis affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, causing an estimated 1.3 million deaths each year.

Some studies show that every 30 minutes, someone in the world dies of Hepatitis.

The international efforts led by the WHO demonstrate the scale of the fight against this disease.

Japan's whooping cough surge prompts Taiwan alert for kids
----------------------------------------------------------
Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on Saturday [19 Jul 2025] urged families traveling to Japan with children to ensure their pertussis (whooping cough) vaccinations are complete, following a significant spike in cases there.

Japan reported 3578 new pertussis cases between 30 Jun and 6 Jul 2025 -- the highest weekly total since 2018. Tokyo had the most cases (277), followed by Saitama Prefecture (254), according to CDC spokesperson Lo Yi-chun.

So far this year [2025], Japan has logged over 43 000 cases and 4 infant deaths. The CDC also noted that drug-resistant strains have been identified.

Health officials attributed the rise to more time spent indoors in the hot summer heat and increased social activity during the holiday season, both of which may drive transmission.

Nearly 60% of Japan's cases have been in teenagers. Japanese health authorities say vaccine protection often wanes by middle school, and recommend a booster at ages 11-12.

Taiwan's standard vaccination schedule includes pertussis shots at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months, with a booster given before elementary school, according to the CDC.'

Health officials also recommend a self-paid booster (Tdap) for unvaccinated teens aged 11-18, especially those living with infants or pregnant women.

Pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the respiratory tract. Early symptoms resemble a cold, but often develop into severe coughing fits that may last for weeks.

Uganda said Thursday [17 Jul 2025] that it would use 200 000 doses of the hepatitis B vaccine donated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to immunize newborns.

Rose Akuno, hepatitis program coordinator at the Ministry of Health, told Xinhua by telephone that the vaccination campaign, scheduled for August [2025], aims to prevent and control new hepatitis B infections among newborns in the East African country.

According to ministry data, about 2.7 million adults and 230 000 children -- roughly 6 percent of Uganda's population -- remain critically infected with the virus.

Akuno said that all newborns, whether born in health facilities or at home, should be vaccinated within the first 24 hours of birth.

""The mothers should ensure the newborns receive this vaccine to prevent and protect them from hepatitis B,"" she said.

The donation from Gavi is expected to arrive in the country later this month or early next month, according to the Health Ministry.

Akuno said that Uganda faces significant funding challenges in the fight against hepatitis B, with only USD 3 million allocated to the program.

In 2022, an estimated 1250 Ugandans died of the disease, according to the World Health Organization.

Hepatitis B can cause chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer, according to the Ministry of Health. It spreads through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person.

[Editado por Jaime Torres]


Canadá erradicó oficialmente el sarampión en 1998, pero con 3 mil 500 casos confirmados este año, este país de 40 millones de habitantes tiene ahora más contagios que su vecino Estados Unidos -que vive su peor epidemia de sarampión en más de 30 años- y que cualquier otro país occidental, según cifras de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), actualizadas el 9 de julio.

Hay diferentes comunidades afectadas, pero los expertos creen que los grupos anabaptistas antivacunas de las provincias de Ontario (sureste) y Alberta (oeste) son los que más están contribuyendo a la epidemia.

Brett Hueston, que se crió en una de estas cominidades, indicó que antes del covid no prestaba atención a las dos visiones del mundo de los habitantes de esta ciudad bucólica rodeada de tierras agrícolas en el suroeste de Ontario. Pero eso cambió. ""Crecí pensando, quizá ingenuamente, que todos estábamos en la misma sintonía como comunidad"", dice este hombre de 40 años, cuya familia publica el periódico local Aylmer Express, de 145 años de antigüedad. ""El covid realmente disparó las diferencias que existían"", añade.

Aylmer y sus 13 iglesias -para una población de 8 mil habitantes- fueron un auténtico hervidero de pólvora durante la pandemia. Una de las principales congregaciones, la Iglesia de Dios de Aylmer, situada en un amplio y cuidado predio, desafió las restricciones de confinamiento y su pastor, Henry Hildebrandt, pagó una multa de 65.000 dólares canadienses (unos 47.000 dólares estadounidenses) por reunir fieles. ""Obedecí a Dios antes que a los hombres"", dijo entonces Hildebrandt, al reconocer que había infringido la ley a sabiendas.

Michelle Barton, directora de la división de enfermedades infecciosas en el hospital infantil del London Health Sciences Center, en Ontario, trató este año algunos de los casos más graves de sarampión pediátrico. Es ""difícil ver"" la reaparición de un virus que había sido erradicado, declaró. Sin embargo, señaló que no todos los casos están necesariamente relacionados con menonitas no vacunados. Como ejemplo, mencionó las infecciones entre nuevos inmigrantes que no se vacunaron tras instalarse en Canadá, en parte debido a la grave escasez de médicos de familia.

Desde hace tiempo es evidente que la presencia de ""grupos de personas sin vacunar"" ha hecho a la región más vulnerable al sarampión, aunque encontró posiciones diversas de las familias menonitas respecto a las vacunas.

Ante la enfermedad de sus hijos, algunas madres se mostraron abiertas a vacunarlos, pero cambiaron de opinión temiendo la reacción de su esposo o pastor. ""No quieren ir en contra de su cultura ni de los ancianos (de la iglesia)"", explicó Barton. La médica dijo sentir empatía con la comunidad menonita, que se enfrenta al ""resentimiento"" de ciertos profesionales de la salud frustrados por una epidemia que podría haberse evitado.

Para Alon Vaisman, médico especialista en enfermedades infecciosas de la University Health Network de Ontario, las autoridades deben seguir buscando convencer a los líderes religiosos de la necesidad de la vacunación, independientemente de su oposición. ""Desde la perspectiva de la salud pública, no debemos considerar nada insuperable cuando se trata de campañas de vacunación"", declaró.

Las tasas de vacunación infantil se mantienen muy por debajo de lo que deberían, lo que posibilita un nuevo brote viral, especialmente de sarampión, afirmó Vaisman.

Diphtheria outbreak devastates northern Nigeria amid poor healthcare funding, sanitation crisis
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
States in northern Nigeria are facing a worsening public health emergency as an outbreak of diphtheria, a deadly bacterial disease, continues to claim lives and infect thousands across the region.

A review of data from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) shows that the outbreak, which began in 2022, has significantly impacted several states, with Kano, Yobe, Bauchi, Katsina, and Borno recording the highest number of cases and deaths.

According to the NCDC, between 2022 and May 2025, Kano State alone recorded 24 415 suspected diphtheria cases, with 18 284 cases confirmed. The state has suffered 860 deaths from the outbreak, making it the hardest hit so far.

In Yobe State, health authorities confirmed 2411 cases, with 109 deaths. Bauchi followed with 2334 confirmed cases and 104 deaths. In Katsina State, there were 1610 confirmed cases and 132 deaths, while Borno State recorded 1166 confirmed cases and 69 fatalities.

The NCDC describes diphtheria as ""a serious bacterial infection caused by _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, which produces toxins that affect the nose, throat, and sometimes the skin."" It can cause severe respiratory issues, heart failure, paralysis, and, in many cases, death if not promptly treated.

On 8 Jul 2025, Bello Jamoh, executive secretary of the Kaduna State Primary Healthcare Board, confirmed that the state had been battling the outbreak for the past 10 months, with cases dating back to October 2024. In Zaria, at least 3 children have died, and 6 others have been infected in a fresh wave of suspected diphtheria cases.

Despite the continued spread, this disease is not new. In March 2023, Salma Suwaid, the diphtheria case manager for Kano State, revealed that 61 people had died from the disease in the state at the time. Since then, the death toll has sharply risen, indicating a systemic failure in containment and prevention.

Public health experts have consistently emphasized that good hygiene and immunization are critical in preventing the spread of diphtheria. However, the stark reality in many northern states is that access to basic sanitary facilities is alarmingly poor -- posing a major hurdle to disease-prevention efforts.

Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) paints a bleak picture. In Bauchi State, 65% of households lack access to sanitary facilities. The situation is similar in Borno (47%), Gombe (75%), Kaduna (73%), Kano (51%), and Katsina (61%). These conditions make the population highly vulnerable to infectious diseases, especially among children and the elderly.

The outbreak is further compounded by chronic underinvestment in primary healthcare across these states. Budget implementation data reveals a disturbing pattern of poor utilization of allocated healthcare funds.

Over time, public health analysts have warned that without urgent interventions -- including increased budget releases, improved vaccination coverage, and massive investment in sanitation infrastructure -- diphtheria and similar outbreaks may become the norm rather than the exception in northern Nigeria. For now, the human cost continues to mount, with thousands infected and families grieving across the region.

There are calls for a better health system to tackle the disease outbreaks that have now made many families casualties and thousands have lost hope of survival.

Hepatitis A cases double in Pune: Know silent symptoms and who's most at risk
---------------------------------------------------------
Pune is witnessing a sharp rise in hepatitis A cases this year [2025], and what's worrying health officials is not just the growing number of infections but the increase in severity of cases. Between March and June 2025, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) recorded 57 cases of viral hepatitis, which is more than double the 26 cases reported during the same months last year [2024]. Most of these infections have been identified as hepatitis A, a liver infection linked to poor water hygiene.

Health experts say the increase in rain has led to water contamination, and that could be a major factor behind the severity of cases. This monsoon, several areas in Pune have reported water logging and pipe leakages, conditions that allow sewage to mix with drinking water, one of the main causes of hepatitis A outbreaks.

Usually, hepatitis A is mild and clears up on its own. But this year [2025], more patients are arriving with stronger symptoms, and some even need hospital care. In previous years, hepatitis A was mostly mild, but now cases are more complicated, showing symptoms similar to hepatitis E.

A 2019 study published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology found that hepatitis A outbreaks often rise during the monsoon due to contaminated water, especially in urban areas with aging infrastructure.

Most people recover fully, but in some cases, especially older adults or people with liver conditions, the infection can become serious or even life-threatening.

Many studies have shown that hepatitis A cases spike during the rainy season. Experts also warn that climate change is making things worse. Unpredictable and extreme rains are overwhelming city drainage systems, allowing sewage to contaminate water supplies, a perfect environment for viruses like hepatitis A to spread.

Hepatitis A is vaccine preventable.

Rare zoonotic infection detected in human samples for first time in NE India
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A mysterious fever outbreak in Assam's Goalpara district has led to the detection of a rare and emerging zoonotic infection -- _Leptospira wolffii_ -- in human samples for the first time in northeast India. The outbreak, which occurred between February and March 2024, also involved co-infections with the hepatitis A virus (HAV), complicating clinical outcomes and resulting in multiple fatalities.

A team  from the ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Dibrugarh, and collaborating institutions conducted the investigation after a sudden outbreak of unknown fever and jaundice in 5 villages of Goalpara, located roughly 130 km west of Guwahati. The outbreak involved an unknown fever with jaundice-like symptoms and reported fatalities across the 5 villages.

Laboratory investigations revealed that 40% of the tested individuals were positive for _Leptospira_-specific IgM antibodies, while 23% tested positive for HAV. Notably, 17% of the cases showed co-infection with both pathogens, making diagnosis and treatment particularly challenging.

Clinical samples from 30 individuals were analyzed using a combination of serological tests and molecular diagnostics, including next-generation sequencing. ""The findings, along with reported fatalities, emphasize the pathogenic potential of _L. wolffii_ and its likely introduction into the region via cross-border transmission from neighboring Bangladesh, where the strain is prevalent,"" the investigators note.

Leptospirosis, caused by _Leptospira_ spp., infects over 1 million people globally and accounts for approximately 60 000 deaths annually. It is a waterborne disease prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, typically transmitted through contact with urine of infected animals or contaminated environments. The disease can manifest with a wide range of symptoms, from mild to severe, including fever, jaundice, myalgia, headache, anorexia, cough, and abdominal pain.

_Leptospira wolffii_, a member of the P2 subclade of _Leptospira_, is increasingly gaining attention for its emerging role in human disease. The bacterium had not previously been reported in human clinical samples in northeast India. It belongs to a group of spirochetes that thrive in waterlogged or unsanitary environments and spread via the urine of infected animals, contaminating local water sources.

The study -- based on 41 cases, including 11 deaths -- reported that patients presented with fever, jaundice, headache, myalgia, and nausea. ""Among the symptomatic cases, 45% were positive for _Leptospira_ IgM ELISA,"" the study stated, with PCR and next-generation sequencing confirming the presence of _L. wolffii_ DNA in urine samples.

Health authorities were advised to initiate control measures. As part of the immediate response, residents of the affected villages were advised to use safe drinking water and recommended to take prophylactic antibiotic therapy, preferably doxycycline (200 mg weekly).

The outbreak underscores the vulnerability of flood-prone regions like Goalpara to waterborne and zoonotic diseases, particularly in the context of poor sanitation and close human-animal interactions. With climate variability and cross-border transmission playing increasing roles in disease dynamics, experts emphasize that proactive detection and response systems are critical.

Maharashtra has reported a surge in hepatitis infections, with one of its major cities, Pune, witnessing a sharp rise in hepatitis A. What has made the situation even more concerning is not the unprecedented growth in the cases but the worsening intensity of the condition.

Hepatitis A cases in Pune double this year
---
It has been reported that in the period between March 2025 and June 2025, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has recorded 57 cases of viral hepatitis, and what is alarming is that this number is more than double the cases that were reported in the same month last year [2024], which was 26.

On testing, the majority of these cases of infections have been detected positive for hepatitis A, which is an infection that is known to affect the liver and occurs due to poor water hygiene. Nothing of the cause of the infection, the health experts have highlighted a few possible concerns, including the increase in rain, which has led to the contamination of water. This, according to them, is the major possible reason behind the intensity of the cases.

As it has been reported, with the onset of monsoon, many areas and localities in Pune have seen a problem of water logging and leakages of pipes, and all of this is contributing to the increase in the problem of sewage mixing with potable or drinking water. This continues to be the main reason behind the surge of hepatitis A outbreaks.

Hepatitis A severity raises concerns this year
---
The severity of the hepatitis A infection is considered to be at a higher level than in past years. Usually, it has been noted that the condition remains mild to moderate and ends up clearing up on its own. But what has alarmed the public and the authorities this year [2025] is that more patients have been detected, and many of them have reported having stronger symptoms, while some of them have also been admitted to hospitals for extra care.

The past years, too, have reported hepatitis cases, but the intensity wasn't serious, unlike this year [2025], when the infection is reflecting symptoms of a more severe variant of the condition, that is, hepatitis E.

What is triggering hepatitis A cases in Pune?
---
A 2019 study, which was published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, has stated that the hepatitis A infection often peaks during the period of monsoon, as it is known to originate due to contaminated water that is more rampant in urban localities.

Another study, which was made in 2021 by Central India, published in The Lancet Regional Health, highlighted that hepatitis A accounted for about 11.5 per cent of all hospitalisations due to viral hepatitis. Most patients recovered without facing the intensity of the virus, but the study also reported more severe illness among adults, especially those with low immunity.

What is hepatitis A?
---
Hepatitis A is known to primarily spread through contaminated food or water. This is the virus that is prevalent in India these days. It often causes a short-term illness with full recovery. Hepatitis A symptoms can vary from mild to severe, and the symptoms often include flu-like symptoms, like jaundice, and other gastrointestinal issues.

How to prevent hepatitis A
---
To prevent hepatitis A, focus on vaccination, practising good hygiene, and being cautious with food and water, especially when travelling. Thorough handwashing, especially after using the restroom and before meals, is crucial. Additionally, ensuring food is well-cooked and water is purified can significantly reduce the risk of infection.

Vaccination
---
If you want to go for the most effective way to prevent hepatitis A, then it's the vaccine that is the answer. The hepatitis A vaccine is generally given in 2 shots, and it's recommended for children over 12 months as part of routine vaccinations. Individuals who are more prone to the risk, such as those who visit the palaces with high prevalence, or those with serious health conditions, should also consider vaccination on the advice of the doctor.

Handwashing
---
It is very important to keep your hands clean. One must frequently and thoroughly wash hands with soap and water, as it is one of the essential tips to tackle the virus. More specifically, the people are asked to wash their hands after using the restroom, changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food.

Opting for safe food and water practices
---
The people are asked to avoid raw or undercooked shellfish, which can be the case in southern India, where diets are often of sea-based foods. Shellfish, specifically the ones that are caught from the potentially contaminated waters, should be thoroughly cooked before consumption.

Hepatitis A is a health condition that can be serious if not treated properly. This condition is known to spread through the consumption of contaminated water and food. Apart from this, it can also spread through coming in contact with a person who has already been infected. The authorities have asked the people to remain vigilant and report any symptoms to a doctor as soon as possible, as any delay in reporting can lead to a serious situation, including a delayed diagnosis and treatment, which can result in the escalation and severity of the disease.

Measles is surging in Yemen’s Dhamar governorate, where many people do not have access to vaccination against this deadly, yet preventable disease. Doctors Without Borders/ Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) conducted an assessment in Dhamar in March and found that measles cases had doubled compared to last year [2024].

MSF’s emergency team then launched a rapid response in the governorate in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, aiming to treat measles patients and contain the severe outbreak. Since April [2025], our team has been providing much-needed medical care to children affected by the disease in Dhamar.

More than a decade of ongoing conflict has exhausted Yemen and significantly limited access to health care, making people more vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles. With many areas lacking adequate access to vaccination or health care, families are watching their children suffer from high fevers, rashes, and complications that could have been avoided with timely medical intervention.

One of the key components of MSF’s response is our mobile emergency team, which can respond quickly and directly to communities’ urgent medical needs by mobilizing resources, setting up temporary clinics, and providing immediate medical care. This rapid response capability is crucial to controlling the spread of infectious diseases like measles.

The team is currently treating patients in the isolation ward at Al-Wahda Hospital, which has a capacity of 40 beds. We also provide free medical consultations through 3 mobile clinics that travel across 6 districts in the governorate.

Given the difficulties these patients face in accessing necessary health care, the team also provides referrals and patient transport services from the mobile clinics to the isolation center and transfers severe cases to more advanced medical centers.

Between April and July 2025, the MSF team has treated more than 1400 measles patients in Dhamar at Al-Wahda Hospital and mobile clinics, with more than 56% of patients being children under 5.

While it is difficult to identify all the factors that increase the challenges of combating measles and other preventable diseases, significant gaps in routine vaccination and limited access to basic health care facilities play a major role in the large increase in the number of measles patients.

Toronto health officials warn of possible hepatitis A exposure at downtown restaurant
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Toronto Public Health (TPH) is advising the public of a possible hepatitis A exposure at a downtown restaurant after an employee tested positive for the virus.

The health unit said those who dined at Earls Kitchen + Bar at 601 King St. W., at Portland Street, on the following dates and times may have been exposed:
- Friday, July 11 from 4 p.m. to close
- Saturday, July 12 from 4:30 p.m. to close
- Tuesday, July 15 from 4:30 p.m. to close
- Wednesday, July 16 from 7 p.m. to close

Diners who may have been exposed to the virus are being urged to get vaccinated as soon as possible. According to TPH, the vaccine is most effective when received within 14 days of exposure. Toronto Public Health added customers should watch for signs and symptoms, and wash their hands often and thoroughly with soap and warm water. ""There is no ongoing risk to the public,"" TPH said in a release.

Symptoms of hepatitis A, which can cause a liver infection, and include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea/vomiting, dark urine, stomach pains, and jaundice. ""Symptoms can last a few days to several months. Most people who are infected recover completely and develop lifetime immunity following infection,"" public health said, noting that death from hepatitis A infection is rare.

Infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch said hepatitis A is transmitted from person to person either through direct contact, through the fecal or oral route or through contaminated food or water.

""It's got a longish incubation period, anywhere from 2 weeks, even longer than a month. Kids tend to not get all that sick with this infection, but adults can get profoundly ill,"" Bogoch said. ""File (this) under an infection you don't want to get and (something) that's totally preventable.""

Bogoch urged anyone who may have been exposed to get the hepatitis A vaccine, which he described as ""really incredible."" ""It lasts probably decades, and likely it's a lifelong protection against hepatitis A."" He added, ""People tend to get better from this, but it is a rough ride, and it's a very tough infection.""

TPH is hosting free hepatitis A vaccine clinics at Metro Hall on July 25 from 4 to 7 p.m. and on July 26 [2025] from 4 to 6:30 p.m.

El Ministerio de Salud informó este domingo 20 de julio que los casos confirmados de sarampión en Bolivia han aumentado a 148. Este incremento se ha observado especialmente en comunidades menonitas, donde se ha registrado un brote sostenido. Además, se han reportado contagios en casi todo el país, a excepción de Tarija, que es el único departamento que, hasta el momento, se mantiene libre de la enfermedad.

Santa Cruz es el departamento que concentra la mayoría de los casos, con 124 contagios. Le siguen La Paz con 11, Potosí con 4, Beni con 3, y Chuquisaca y Cochabamba con 2 cada uno. Oruro y Pando han reportado un caso cada uno.

El viceministro de Promoción y Vigilancia Epidemiológica, Max Enríquez, expresó su preocupación por las comunidades menonitas, donde la cobertura de vacunación es baja y los contagios se mantienen de forma sostenida. Enríquez destacó que “las comunidades menonitas, que presentan baja cobertura de vacunación, están registrando brotes sostenidos”.

Esto ha llevado a las autoridades a considerar la necesidad de tomar acciones más contundentes para aumentar la vacunación. “Afortunadamente, ya hay una mayor apertura, pero necesitamos ser más contundentes, y eso es lo que estamos organizando para los próximos días”, agregó el viceministro.
 
Las autoridades están impulsando campañas masivas de vacunación en todo el país, dirigidas a la población de 1 a 14 años. Enríquez indicó que el objetivo es alcanzar a los niños que no han iniciado su esquema de inmunización o que no han completado las dos dosis necesarias. Para los mayores de 10 años, se aplica la vacuna SR (sarampión y rubéola).

La autoridad alertó que el virus afecta principalmente a las personas no vacunadas. Además, el receso pedagógico representa una oportunidad clave para avanzar en la inmunización. También advirtió que el flujo turístico entre departamentos puede facilitar la propagación del virus.

Cochabamba, que hasta hace unos días no reportaba casos, confirmó sus primeros dos contagios este fin de semana: un bebé de 3 meses y un joven de 20 años.

Three inmates from the same division at Corradino Correctional Facility have been hospitalized after testing positive for hepatitis A, but the government stressed that the situation is ""under control"".

""Three individuals have recently tested positive for hepatitis A. These are isolated cases, and based on the current assessment, this does not constitute an outbreak,"" the Home Affairs Ministry said in a statement. The ministry confirmed to Times of Malta that the individuals referred to in its statement were prisoners at the facility.

Hepatitis A is a virus that infects the liver. It is most commonly transmitted through contaminated food or water or close contact with a person.

The ministry said initial investigations revealed there was no indication the cases were related to any operational or environmental factors within the facility. Health Authorities are also carrying out their own investigations, the ministry added.

To prevent the further spread of the virus, inmates and staff within the affected division will be administered the hepatitis A vaccine on Saturday [26 Jul 2025]. ""As a precaution, all necessary steps are being taken to safeguard the health and wellbeing of both residents and staff. The situation is under control and is being closely monitored,"" the ministry said.

Earlier this year [2025], the prison also sounded the alarm after an inmate tested positive for tuberculosis.

The program, which began in February 2025, focuses on eliminating mother-to-child transmission of the virus. It includes free screening and treatment for pregnant women, as well as vaccination for newborns. The state is also working to ensure blood safety and integrate hepatitis care into existing health services. The government is seeking support from partners to eliminate hepatitis as a public health threat.

<https://dailytrust.com/1-2m-people-suffering-from-hepatitis-in-kano-commissioner/>


The Kano State Government has revealed that at least over 1.2 million residents are currently living with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the state.

The Commissioner of Health, Dr. Abubakar Labaran Yusuf, made this known on Monday [28 Jul 2025] during a press briefing in Kano as part of activities marking the 2025 World Hepatitis Day (WHD), themed ""Hepatitis: Let's Break the Silence.""

He described the disease as a major but preventable public health challenge in the state, warning that if left untreated, HBV could lead to life-threatening complications such as liver cirrhosis and cancer.

""Kano State reflects the national trend, and the need for urgent intervention cannot be overstated,"" the commissioner said.

To tackle the disease, Yusuf announced that the state government has released NGN 95 million [about USD 62 100] to support a new public health initiative titled ""HepFree Mothers, Healthy Babies"" (also known as ""HepFree Uwadajariri"").

The project, launched in February 2025, is aimed at eliminating mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B, aligning with Nigeria's ""Triple Elimination"" strategy for HIV, hepatitis, and syphilis, as well as the global 2030 targets.

He said Kano was the first state in the country to independently initiate and fund the Triple Elimination programme, which provides free screening and treatment for pregnant women who test positive for hepatitis B.

Under the scheme, women begin treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) at 32 weeks of pregnancy to prevent transmission to their babies. In addition, trained immunisation officers have been deployed to labour wards to administer the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine to newborns at birth, also free of charge.

Yusuf noted that mother-to-child transmission accounts for between 70 and 80 percent of hepatitis B infections in Nigeria, making birth-dose vaccination a critical element in curbing the disease.

He further disclosed that the state has proposed an additional NGN 135 million [USD 88 246] to expand the programme and procure more supplies for effective implementation.

The initiative is currently being piloted at 7 major health facilities, including Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital; Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital; Muhammad Wase Teaching Hospital; General Hospital, Gaya; General Hospital, Bichi; and General Hospital, Wudil.

""These centres are providing free hepatitis B screening and treatment to all eligible pregnant women, with technical support from the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and other partners,"" he said.

On blood safety, the commissioner also confirmed that all public and private blood transfusion centres in Kano State are now mandated to screen donated blood for hepatitis to prevent transmission.

He added that the government plans to integrate hepatitis care into maternal, newborn, and child health services across the state's healthcare system, while strengthening commodity supply chains and data management for better treatment outcomes.

He called on development partners, private sector stakeholders, and the media to support the state's hepatitis elimination drive through funding, advocacy, and public sensitisation.

""Together, we can eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat in Kano State and across Nigeria,"" he said.

Daily Trust reports that World Hepatitis Day is commemorated globally every 28 July to raise awareness about the disease and accelerate action toward its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Measles case confirmed in traveler who passed through LAX, county health officials say
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Public Health officials have confirmed a case of measles in a traveler who passed through Los Angeles International Airport while infectious earlier this month [July 2025].

County Department of Public Health officials warned that people may have been exposed, with the risk of infection higher for people who are not immunized against measles. According to health officials, the patient was at LAX on July 5 [2025], but the exact time and flight information were still under investigation. The patient is also believed to have visited the Hilton Los Angeles Airport, 5711 W. Century Blvd., between 7:30 p.m. July 5 and 1 p.m. July 7.

Health officials warned that people who were at those locations during those times could be at risk of developing measles between 7 and 21 days from exposure. Such people should verify their vaccination status and monitor themselves for symptoms.

""Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can linger in the air and on surfaces, making it easy to spread, particularly among people who are not already protected from it,"" Dr. Muntu Davis, county health officer, said in a statement. ""A person can spread the illness to others before they have symptoms, and it can take 7 to 21 days for symptoms to show up after exposure. Measles can lead to severe disease in young children and vulnerable adults. The best way to protect yourself and your family from infection is with the highly effective measles vaccine.""

Symptoms of measles can include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and fatigue. A red rash usually appears 1 to 4 days after symptoms begin, starting at the head and then spreading to the lower body. There is no cure or treatment.

Immunization crisis deepens as girl dies of diphtheria at PIMS
--------------------------------------------------------------

A 14-year-old girl from Nankana district has died of diphtheria at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Islamabad, while 2 more children -- one from Buner, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and another from Swabi -- remain critically ill in the isolation ward, highlighting Pakistan's deepening immunization crisis, federal health officials confirmed on Saturday [26 Jul 2025].

All 3 are lab-confirmed cases of diphtheria, a vaccine-preventable disease virtually eradicated in most parts of the world, but now resurging in Pakistan due to dangerously low immunization coverage and widespread neglect in provincial vaccination programs.

The deceased girl was admitted to the PIMS on July 22 [2025] with high-grade fever, neck swelling, and respiratory distress. Despite aggressive treatment, including intravenous diphtheria antitoxin (DAT), she succumbed to myocarditis, acute kidney injury, and severe metabolic acidosis on July 26.

The second patient, an 8-year-old girl from Buner with Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, is currently on low-flow oxygen at the PIMS. Medical records reveal she was immunization-incomplete, and her condition deteriorated after 7 days of sore throat and fever. Her father is deceased, and her illiterate mother was unaware of her vaccination history.

The third patient, a 12-year-old boy from KP, was discharged from the PIMS on July 25 [2025] after a prolonged ICU stay. He was diagnosed with diphtheria complicated by neuropathy, myocarditis, and aspiration pneumonia and had presented with 105°F fever, grayish throat membrane, and breathing difficulty.

These alarming cases have reignited concern over the country's immunization failures. Though diphtheria antitoxin is available in limited quantities, officials say the real issue is the rising number of zero-dose children, those who have never received a single vaccine dose despite the availability of free vaccines under the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI).

""Pakistan's EPI vaccines including three doses of the pentavalent vaccine administered on 6, 10, and 14 weeks are universally available and free of cost,"" said a senior infectious diseases specialist at the PIMS. ""Yet, due to chronic mismanagement, corruption, and the hiring of incompetent staff at provincial levels, large numbers of children remain unvaccinated and vulnerable to deadly but preventable diseases.""

According to an advisory issued on July 26 [2025] by the District Health Office (DHO) Islamabad, diphtheria poses a renewed public health threat, with many children still susceptible due to missed vaccinations. The advisory emphasizes urgent vaccination, rapid treatment initiation, and strict infection control measures. Despite its preventability, diphtheria continues to resurface. Experts warn that even with proper treatment, 1 in 10 patients with respiratory diphtheria may die, and without treatment, mortality can reach 50%. Younger children and immune-compromised patients are especially at risk. What further complicates the outbreak response is a lack of reliable national data. ""Punjab, Sindh, KP, and Balochistan fail to share confirmed case data with the NIH,"" a surveillance official said. ""We only receive scattered suspected case reports, making it impossible to track real-time outbreaks.""

International organizations including WHO, Unicef, and Gavi have flagged Pakistan's growing number of zero-dose children as a major global concern. Despite spending billions of rupees on immunization with significant foreign donor support, the vaccination system continues to miss hundreds of thousands of children each year.

""This is not a problem of funding. It's a crisis of governance and accountability,"" said a former Health Ministry official. ""Without urgent reforms and enforcement, we are heading back to the pre-vaccine era where children die of diphtheria, measles, polio, and other diseases long defeated by the world.""

The Ministry of Health has again urged parents to ensure full vaccination of children, especially the pentavalent doses, while healthcare professionals are advised to initiate treatment without waiting for lab confirmation in suspected cases.

As more children fight for their lives and one has already lost hers, the resurgence of diphtheria serves as a damning indictment of Pakistan's broken immunization system and a wake-up call that preventable diseases are back with deadly consequences.

Two Israeli children who were hospitalized with the measles have been connected to ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation - Mod.LL] life support machines, Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem's Ein Kerem said on Sunday morning [27 Jul 2025].

Over the weekend, a 1-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital in a grave condition with respiratory distress. The child was admitted to an intensive care unit, where she was connected to an ECMO machine.

In addition, a 2-year-old boy with measles was evacuated to Hadassah from the capital's Shaare Zedek Medical Center after being diagnosed with a secondary infection with pneumococcus [_Streptococcus pneumoniae_ - Mod.LL] that caused pneumonia.

Dr. Uri Pollak, the director of Hadassah's pediatric intensive care units, urged parents to vaccinate their children amid the measles outbreak.

""Measles is a viral disease that spreads rapidly, especially in enclosed spaces. It is a severe and dangerous illness that presents with fever, general malaise, runny nose and a rash, and it can lead to serious complications and life-threatening conditions,"" Pollak said.

However, ""severe illness can be prevented and lives can be saved -- it's in the hands of the parents,"" he added. ""The effectiveness of the vaccine is proven, and it is very important to maintain a full vaccination routine for all children in the household to prevent dangerous infection.""

Israeli health authorities in May [2025] launched an emergency vaccination campaign targeting both children and adults in areas with low immunization rates.

In 2018, an unvaccinated 18-month-old from Jerusalem died of measles, in Israel's first fatality from the disease in 15 years. The following year, a 43-year-old Israeli flight attendant, who had received only one dose of the vaccine, died after contracting the virus during a flight.

Hepatitis A outbreak linked to Earls Kitchen: what you need to know
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The recent outbreak of hepatitis A linked to Earls Kitchen has raised concerns across Canada, particularly for patrons who dined at the restaurant. Health officials emphasized the importance of awareness regarding foodborne illnesses, and hepatitis A poses a significant risk to public health due to its contagious nature.

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, at least 15 confirmed cases of hepatitis A have been reported in individuals who consumed food at Earls Kitchen locations. The source of the outbreak is believed to be associated with contaminated food products. Consequently, establishments across Canada have been advised to review their food preparation and hygiene practices rigorously to prevents further spread of the virus.

Health authorities indicated that the virus can cause mild to severe illness, with symptoms including fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice -- yellowing of the skin and eyes. While hepatitis A can be serious, most affected individuals will recover completely. Vaccination is available and recommended as a preventive measure for those who may have been exposed.

In light of the outbreak, Earls Kitchen has taken significant steps to address the situation, including temporarily closing certain locations for thorough cleaning and implementation of enhanced food safety protocols. The management expressed their commitment to ensuring customer safety and has encouraged anyone who dined at the affected locations to seek medical advice if they experience symptoms.

This outbreak serves as a critical reminder of the importance of food safety in restaurants and the need for establishments to maintain rigorous hygiene standards. Patrons are encouraged to be vigilant, especially when dining out. Health officials advise those who may have been exposed to monitor their health closely and consult healthcare providers for guidance. Ultimately, involvement from the public and diligence from food establishments will contribute to curbing such outbreaks and ensuring a safer dining experience.

Cases of whooping cough increase in Haywood County, North Carolina
----------------------------------------------------------------
Officials in Haywood County, North Carolina, have confirmed their ninth active case of pertussis (whooping cough) within the county. On Wednesday [23 Jul 2025], officials said among the confirmed cases, one is an adult, and the rest are children and teens under the age of 19. Haywood Health and Human Services will continue to monitor closely and will provide updates to the community as the number of active cases changes.

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory illness that spreads through coughing or sneezing. It causes intense coughing fits that can interfere with breathing, eating, and sleeping. The illness can be especially dangerous for babies, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems.

Common symptoms of whooping cough:
- long or severe coughing fits
- a ""whooping"" sound when breathing in after a cough
- vomiting after coughing
- runny nose or stuffy nose
- mild fever (or no fever at all)

How to protect yourself and others:

Get vaccinated: Health officials say vaccines are the best way to prevent whooping cough.

Whooping cough health advisory goes out for Whitman County
------------------------------------------------
New cases of pertussis (whooping cough) in Whitman County are under investigation by the Whitman County Public Health, who has issued a community health advisory on the matter.

As of 23 Jul 2025, Whitman County Public Health is investigating 2 cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. The cases are epi-linked, which they explained means that people got sick from the same source. The phrase is short for epidemiologically linked.

Whooping cough is a serious respiratory illness caused by the bacteria _Bordatella pertussis_. It is spread through small drops of spit shared from the mouth or nose during talking, coughing, or sneezing.

""It begins with cold-like symptoms and develops into a bad cough,"" wrote Whitman County Public Health.

However, coughing spells can be severe and can end in gagging or vomiting. Complications of whooping cough can include pneumonia, passing out, seizures, stopping breathing, and death. These severe complications are most common in infants.

There are tests available for whooping cough. Whitman County Public Health recommends polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, but said that a negative test does not mean that the sick person should stop treatment. [Antimicrobials] are available for those with whooping cough as well as those who have been exposed to whooping cough. Diagnosed people should isolate for either 5 days of antibiotic treatment or 21 days after symptoms start.

However, immunization is the most effective way to prevent whooping cough, they said.

--------------------------------------------------------
A case of measles has been confirmed in a dormitory associated with the Central Yeshiva Tomchei Tmimim Lubavitch - 770 Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, prompting urgent health guidance from the ODA Crown Heights Health Center.

The patient, a young Yeshiva student from Israel currently studying in the ""Kevutza"" program at 770, was officially diagnosed earlier on Tuesday [29 Jul 2025] with the highly contagious virus.

""The risk of a large-scale outbreak is real,"" stated the medical team at ODA in a public health text message to its patients at 1:19 PM on Tuesday [29 Jul 2025].

The ODA didn't disclose whether this bochur was a resident of the dormitories at 749 Eastern Parkway, 755 Eastern Parkway, 1414 President Street, 1214 Sterling Place, or another in the neighborhood. A medical source told COLlive it was the 755 dormitory.

""Please ensure all children and young adults are vaccinated with MMR. Watch for symptoms: fever, rash, cough, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea,"" the ODA wrote.

Measles is an illness that spreads through respiratory droplets and can cause high fever, cough, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), and diarrhea. It can also lead to serious complications, especially in young children and those with weakened immune systems.

The ODA Health Center, located at 779 East New York Avenue, added, ""If visiting a medical facility with these signs, call ahead so the case can be properly managed and exposure minimized.""

Residents were advised to review their family's vaccination records and contact their doctor or the ODA Health Center with any concerns.

Diphtheria situational Report (Week 29 of 2025)
-----------------------------------------------
Between 1 Jan 2024 and 20 Jul 2025, 65 confirmed cases of respiratory diphtheria, 1 probable respiratory diphtheria case and 50 asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ detected during contact tracing, have been identified in South Africa. The majority of confirmed cases and carriers (68%, 80/117) were from the Western Cape, comprising 41 respiratory diphtheria cases, 1 cutaneous toxigenic diphtheria case, and 38 asymptomatic carriers. The median age for cases of confirmed respiratory diphtheria was 26 years (range: 2-55 years), with 69% (45/65) aged ≥ 18 years. The overall case-fatality ratio (CFR) among probable and confirmed respiratory diphtheria cases was 20% (13/66). Among children and adolescents aged < 18 years, the CFR was 20% (4/20), compared to 20% (9/46) among adults.

Highlights:
-----------
Since the last situational report (week 28), the following updates are included in this report:
- Four new laboratory-confirmed cases of toxigenic respiratory diphtheria, 2 from Gauteng and 2 from the Western Cape.
- Two new asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_, from Gauteng.

Appropriate public health responses have been initiated for all suspected and confirmed cases.

Information for clinicians
--------------------------
Clinical presentation of respiratory diphtheria
Respiratory diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable illness caused by toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ (and more rarely _C. ulcerans_ or _C. pseudotuberculosis_), and can occur in persons of all ages.

The clinical presentation includes the following signs and symptoms:
- sore throat
- low-grade fever
- AND an adherent membrane of the nose, pharynx, tonsils, or larynx -- the membrane is greyish-white and firmly adherent to the tissue
- AND/OR enlarged glands in the neck (bull neck)
- Toxin-mediated systemic signs including myocarditis, polyneuropathy and renal damage

Patient management
------------------
Treatment includes antibiotics (azithromycin or penicillin) to clear the organism from the throat and prevent onward transmission, and diphtheria anti-toxin (DAT) to neutralise unbound toxin. The dosage of DAT is determined by the duration and severity of illness. Treatment, contact tracing and chemoprophylaxis should be started prior to laboratory confirmation. Early administration of DAT may be life-saving and should not be delayed in cases with a high index of suspicion. Supportive care is primarily aimed at airway management and includes providing oxygen, monitoring with electrocardiogram and intubation or performance of a tracheostomy if necessary.

Czechia reports over 900 hepatitis A cases
------------------------------------------

While hepatitis A infections occur in 150 million people annually, most European high-income countries now have low endemicity. However, the Czech Republic, also known as Czechia, is confronted with a significant surge in hepatitis A cases and fatalities.

As of July 21, 2025, Czechia health officials are reporting 928 hepatitis A subgenotype IB cases, including 10 deaths in 2025. This number, based on data from the State Health Institute, has increased by over 100% since April 2025 and already exceeds the total number of hepatitis A cases recorded throughout the entire year of 2024, raising concerns among public health experts across Europe.

Czechia authorities are strongly recommending heightened attention to prevention strategies, particularly for those traveling abroad, where the risk of exposure may be elevated. Travelers are advised to exercise caution with food and water in exotic or high-risk countries.

According to 2024 reports, Prague was the most visited destination in Czechia, attracting about 1.2 million visitors. Travelers are advised to follow the World Health Organization's guideline: ""Boil it, bake it, peel it, or leave it alone."" Most health experts say this simple mantra can significantly reduce the risk of infections related to ingestion.

""Many travelers assume that visiting high-income countries like those in Europe doesn't require vaccination. However, the recent spike in hepatitis A cases in Czechia -- including in tourist hubs like Prague -- underscores the importance of prevention,"" Jeri Beales, MSN, RN, informed Vax-Before-Travel. ""Hepatitis A spreads easily through contaminated food or water, often due to improper hand washing in food service settings. A single vaccine dose given weeks before travel offers strong protection, and a second dose 6 months later provides lifelong immunity. While the vaccine is routine for US children today, many adults remain unprotected against hepatitis A -- leaving them vulnerable.""

""At the same time, on vacation in Europe and at even higher risk if future travel takes them to regions like Latin America, Africa, and Asia,"" added Beales, who leads Destination Health Clinic, a Boston-area travel health provider specializing in health education and vaccination for international travelers.

La ministra de Salud, María Renée Castro, informó que dos personas fueron aprehendidas en San Ignacio de Velasco, Santa Cruz, tras ser descubiertas transportando carne en un contenedor destinado al envío de vacunas, entre ellas más de 200 dosis contra el sarampión.

“Hay dos personas que han sido aprehendidas en San Ignacio de Velazco en Santa Cruz. Nosotros despachamos las vacunas en cadena de frío, cada cadena de frío tiene un termómetro que le hace seguimiento hasta el lugar de destino”, explicó Castro en una conferencia de prensa.

El cargamento debía llegar desde el sistema de salud de San Matías hasta un punto de vacunación en la frontera, donde se estaban reforzando las campañas de inmunización.

Sin embargo, en el trayecto, el precinto de seguridad del contenedor fue vulnerado. “Rompen el precinto, sacan las cajas que nosotros teníamos, cerca de 550 dosis de vacunas; de estas, 230 eran contra el sarampión para reforzar este punto de vacunación, el resto eran otras vacunas diferentes”, denunció la autoridad.

El hecho fue detectado gracias a los dispositivos térmicos: “Nosotros, al tener estos termómetros incorporados, hemos registrado que se había roto la cadena de frío”.

Cuando el personal de salud llegó a recoger el contenedor, descubrió la irregularidad. “El sistema, las enfermeras llegan en busca del cooler e inmediatamente hacen la denuncia. Este medio de transporte trata de evadir la responsabilidad”, indicó.

Tras conocer el caso, el Ministerio de Salud coordinó con el Ministerio de Gobierno para dar con los responsables. “Hablo con el ministro de Gobierno y en la madrugada del sábado se logró detener a estas dos personas”. El Ministerio ya se adhirió formalmente a la denuncia, calificando el hecho como un atentado contra la salud pública.

Aunque suman 12 las muertes por sarampión y unos tres mil 500 casos en el país en lo que va del año, el secretario de Salud del gobierno federal (SSA), David Kershenobich, aseguró que el programa para combatir esta enfermedad “se está controlando bien”. 

Cuestionado en la conferencia presidencial matutina sobre la atención de los contagios de ese virus en el país, dijo que el brote está contenido en Chihuahua: 

“Tenemos todavía alrededor de 3 mil 500 casos de sarampión detectados, en todo este periodo de tiempo. Han fallecido 12 personas por sarampión. Hemos incrementado la vacunación en forma muy importante y el brote está contenido alrededor del estado de Chihuahua”. 

Añadió que en los otros estados “ya prácticamente se ha ido conteniendo en forma importante. Alrededor de Chihuahua es donde realmente tenemos el brote”. 

El funcionario explicó que la dependencia ha dispuesto de un número “importante” de vacunadores, con el apoyo de la gobernadora Maru Campos.  “Se está vacunando en forma intensiva a la población. Afortunadamente, el cerco ha funcionado y está fundamentalmente limitado al estado. La frecuencia y la tasa de incidencia de casos ha disminuido también en forma importante”, dijo.  

Según el titular de la SSA, la meta del gobierno es tratar de que, en noviembre próximo, ya no se tengan casos de sarampión. Agregó que el Programa de Vigilancia Epidemiológica “se ha reforzado mucho en el país con todos los laboratorios estatales. Y los casos confirmados son casos con PCR, con técnicas avanzadas”. 

Por último, informó que se tiene “suficiente” vacuna: alrededor de seis millones y “está por llegar más”. El objetivo, dijo, es que más del 95% de la población esté vacunada.

OPDs full with Hepatitis A, E cases as monsoon picks pace
---------------------------------------------------------
With the onset of monsoon, Delhi-NCR is witnessing a worrying rise in the number of hepatitis A and E cases. Hospitals have reported a sharp rise in OPD [outpatient department] consultations for jaundice, abdominal pain and vomiting with cases rising 40% of disease burden there. 

Dr Abhideep Chaudhary, head of the department of HPB and liver transplantation at the BLK-Max Hospital, said, ""In our OPD, we have seen around 40% increase in acute viral hepatitis cases over the past 3 weeks alone. Many of these patients were unaware of the need for hepatitis vaccination, especially those moving from rural to urban settlements. Hepatitis A and E are largely preventable diseases, yet we see a surge every monsoon due to poor awareness and unsafe water consumption.""

Dr Monika Jain, director, department of liver diseases and GI sciences, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute and Action cancer hospital, concurred. ""In monsoon, we see around 30% jump in cases,"" she said.

The hepatitis A and E viruses, transmitted through contaminated food and water, tend to see seasonal spikes during monsoon due to poor sanitation, waterlogging and compromised hygiene standards.

According to estimates from the Liver Transplant Society of India (LTSI) and hospital-based surveillance data, more than 70% of waterborne hepatitis cases in India during monsoon are attributable to hepatitis E, while hepatitis A remains highly prevalent among children under 15.

LTSI president Dr Sanjiv Saigal, ""We witness a seasonal epidemic every year and yet we are caught off guard every time. These infections are entirely preventable with clean drinking water, proper food handling and vaccination in high-risk groups,"" he added.

Mass screening reveals 177 hepatitis B cases in Yambio
------------------------------------------------------

Health authorities in Western Equatoria State have raised alarm after 177 people tested positive for hepatitis B during ongoing screenings in Yambio. The initiative, led by the Azande Kingdom's Health Department in collaboration with the state government and partner organizations, aims to combat the spread of hepatitis B and C in the state.

Siro Peter David, head of the Azande Kingdom's Health Department, told Radio Tamazuj on Thursday [31 Jul 2025] that 924 people have been screened so far, with cases expected to rise as testing continues. Among those screened, 65 men, 82 women and 10 children tested positive.

David urged increased public awareness efforts in crowded spaces such as churches, markets and schools. ""Hepatitis can affect anyone,"" he said. ""We must educate people through campaigns and mobile screenings.""

Rose Obede, director general of the Western Equatoria State Ministry of Health, said the state also faces challenges from malaria, HIV and other diseases. ""We will not relent in fighting these threats,"" she said. ""Our children must grow up healthy to contribute to society.""

The Catholic Medical Mission Board (CMMB) and the World Health Organization have pledged support. Doru Peni, a CMMB communications officer, praised the Azande Kingdom's leadership and vowed to assist in improving health outcomes.

State Health Minister James Abdallah Arona said officials will work to ensure services reach remote areas. Acting Governor Daniel Badagbu Rimbasa promised government backing, including transportation for testing campaigns. ""Get tested, know your status and seek treatment if needed,"" he said.

Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which spreads through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids. Many infected people show no symptoms initially, but the virus can cause severe liver damage, including cirrhosis and liver cancer, over time.

While there is no cure, vaccines can prevent infection, and antiviral treatments help manage chronic cases.

Santa Cruz faces outbreak of pertussis with 162 positive cases and fatalities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Departmental Health Service (Sedes) of Santa Cruz reported 162 confirmed cases of whooping cough (pertussis) between January and July [2025], after analyzing more than 700 people with suspicious symptoms. In recent weeks, the department has faced a new outbreak, which has already claimed the lives of 4 children under 1 year of age, all without the vaccination schedule against the disease.

Jaime Bilbao, Director of Sedes asked parents to go to health centers to ensure that their children have the 5 doses of the pentavalent vaccine, which protects against whooping cough and other serious diseases. Bilbao explained that the vaccine must be applied from a month and a half of life and complete the scheme until 4 years of age.

Bilbao recommended preventing people with respiratory infections from approaching babies and asked to limit family visits to newborns during the first 3 months, a critical stage for the development of immunity.

----------------------------------------------------------
Although there are 12 deaths from measles and some 3500 cases in the country so far this year [2025] the federal government's Secretary of Health (SSA), David Kershenobich, assured that the program to combat this disease ""is being well controlled.""

Questioned at the morning presidential conference about the attention to the contagion of that virus in the country, he said that the outbreak is contained in Chihuahua.

""We still have around 3500 cases of measles detected, in this entire period of time. Twelve people have died from measles. We have increased vaccination very significantly, and the outbreak is contained around the state of Chihuahua.""

He added that in the other states, ""it has already been practically contained in an important way. Around Chihuahua is where we really have the outbreak.""

The official explained that the agency has had a ""significant"" number of vaccinators, with the support of Governor Maru Campos.

""The population is being vaccinated intensively. Fortunately, the fence has worked and is fundamentally limited to the state. The frequency and incidence rate of cases has also decreased significantly,"" he said.

According to the head of the SSA, the government's goal is to try to ensure that, by next November [2025], there are no more cases of measles. He added that the epidemiological surveillance program ""has been greatly reinforced in the country with all state laboratories. And the confirmed cases are cases with PCR, with advanced techniques.""

Finally, he reported that there is ""enough"" vaccine: around 6 million, and ""more are coming."" The goal, he said, is for more than 95% of the population to be vaccinated.

The cases have emerged from multiple localities including Council River Colony, Phyamai Vabuh, TNK Gate, Yapao Colony, DV School, Road to Emesiiphro, and Mt Everes areas. Authorities added that test results for another 18 individuals showing similar symptoms are still awaited. 

Alarmingly, 10 of the 11 confirmed cases had not received a single dose of the measles vaccine, highlighting major gaps in immunisation coverage. ""A rapid survey of these areas revealed large gaps in immunisation,"" a district official said, urging people to get vaccinated.

The district administration has convened a multi-stakeholder meeting to develop a coordinated response to control the spread of infection and address the vaccine hesitancy, he said. ""Vaccine hesitancy has contributed significantly to the current situation,"" he said.

The outbreak underscores the urgent need to strengthen routine immunisation drives and address vaccine misinformation in remote regions.  Health officials have appealed to the public to ensure timely vaccination to prevent further escalation of the disease.

Doctors fight vaccine mistrust as Romania hit by measles outbreak
-------------------------------------------
When epidemiologist Daniela Gafita makes her rounds in the remote villages of northeastern Romania to educate communities about the risks of measles, she frequently encounters parents who hesitate to have their children vaccinated.

With measles cases in Europe hitting a 25-year high last year, Romania was the country most affected: it recorded 13 000 of the approximately 18 000 cases registered between June 2024 and May 2025 in the European Economic Area, which includes EU members as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. But the disease has also re-emerged globally, with the USA confronting its worst epidemic in 30 years, in part fueled by anti-vaccine misinformation that has been circulating on social media since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite widespread vaccine skepticism in Romania, Gafita and her colleagues from the local health department are undeterred in their mission to spread the immunization message.

""We are trying to recover, little by little, what we lost"" in the past decades when the situation was still at bay, said the 52-year-old.

Romania has the EU's lowest vaccination rate at 62 percent, a far cry from the 95 percent the WHO says is needed for effective control.

But it's a fight on many fronts, due not only to poverty, but also to poor access to healthcare and persistent rumours that vaccination causes autism.

""I heard the vaccine is dangerous,"" said a woman, who declined to give her name, in the village of Raucesti.

[EA], who also lives in the village of 7500 people, told AFP that she did not want her youngest child to be vaccinated after reading ""about a link to autism"" online, a misconception that has been refuted by the scientific community.

""Fear crept into my mind, and I can't shake it off,"" said the 34-year-old.

Her neighbors' children recently ended up in hospital after contracting measles, a contagious disease that causes fever, respiratory symptoms, and a rash -- but can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation, and even death.

Romania reported 8 fatalities from measles between June 2024 to May 2025. In July [2025], a child died in Britain, with 3 deaths being recorded in the United States this year [2025].

Family doctor Monica Apostol told AFP that she was less optimistic than some of her colleagues about Romania's vaccination rate being boosted soon.

""I'm hitting a brick wall,"" she said about her many conversations with parents.

Several factors have contributed to lower vaccination rates and subsequently to the resurgence of measles in Romania, where jabs are offered for free but are not mandatory. Millions of Romanians, including many health professionals, left the country after the end of communism in 1989. Moreover, the country has seen periods of vaccine shortages, but also an underfunded healthcare system and an increasing lack of trust in authorities.

During the COVID pandemic, public figures in Romania, but also worldwide, began launching or endorsing anti-vaccination campaigns, with US President Donald Trump appointing Robert F. Kennedy Jr as health secretary despite his support of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.

Romania's far right also seized on anger over strict pandemic measures and started promoting anti-vaccine beliefs. Far-right leader George Simion, who topped the first round of the presidential election in May [2025] before losing in the second round, has said that parents should have the freedom to decide whether to have their children vaccinated or not.

Pro-European President Nicusor Dan recently called on authorities to redouble their efforts to ""regain people's trust"" and combat a deluge of conspiracy theories and fake news that has eroded confidence.

Израиль начал экстренную вакцинацию младенцев от кори
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Министерство здравоохранения Израиля распорядилось немедленно начать вакцинацию от кори младенцев в возрасте от шести месяцев до одного года в Иерусалиме и Бейт-Шемеше. Решение принято на фоне резкого роста заболеваемости и госпитализации детей, многие из которых находятся в тяжелом состоянии.
Стандартно первая доза вакцины против кори, паротита, краснухи и ветряной оспы (MMRV) вводится только в возрасте одного года, но на этот раз Минздрав сделал исключение.
Согласно официальной директиве, вспышка распространилась стремительно, и по всей стране уже госпитализированы 12 детей младше шести лет - почти все они не были привиты. Четверо малышей оказались в реанимации, двое подключены к аппаратам ЭКМО, поддерживающим работу сердца и легких.
В письме Минздрава, подписанном заместителем главы эпидемиологического отдела доктором Рои Сингером, подчеркивается высокая уязвимость младенцев, особенно в многодетных семьях и в густонаселенных районах. Дети до года не получают плановую вакцинацию и поэтому не имеют иммунной защиты от кори - болезни, способной вызвать серьезные и даже смертельные осложнения.
В срочном порядке была созвана Консультативная комиссия по вакцинации, которая одобрила раннюю вакцинацию детей от шести месяцев до года в двух указанных городах. Малышам будет введена вакцина MMR (корь, паротит, краснуха), которая, по оценкам специалистов, обеспечивает 70–85% защиты в условиях вспышки. Однако эта доза не заменит обязательную вакцинацию - ее придется повторить после достижения одного года и дополнить второй дозой по стандартной схеме.
Из-за ограниченной защиты в младенческом возрасте Минздрав Израиля рекомендует воздерживаться от посещения синагог, праздничных мероприятий и других мест массового скопления. Детям с симптомами ОРВИ - лихорадкой, кашлем, сыпью - предписано оставаться дома до полного выздоровления. При необходимости визита в поликлинику родителей просят заранее уведомить медперсонал для обеспечения изоляции.

9 measles cases reported in Oconto County, Wisconsin's first cases of 2025
--------------------------------------------------------------
Nine cases of measles have been confirmed in Oconto County by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and the county public health department, marking first cases of the year [2025] in Wisconsin. One case was found through testing at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, while the other 8 were identified through symptoms, according to a statement released 2 Aug [2025] by state health officials.

According to health officials, the source of exposure for all 9 cases occurred during out-of-state travel. Risk in the community remains low, according to officials.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads from person to person through the air. Symptoms of measles come 10 to 21 days after contact. Some of the symptoms include a runny nose, high fever, and red rash with bumps. One in 4 people who get measles can end up hospitalized, according to DHS.

For the past few years, public health officials have been raising the alarm about a nationwide trend of slipping vaccination rates, especially for measles, among school-age children. Wisconsin kindergartners have one of the nation's lowest vaccination rates against measles in the country. That puts the state at risk, health officials said, for the disease taking hold and spreading in an under-vaccinated community.

Last school year, less than 85% of Wisconsin kindergartners were up to date on the measles vaccine, compared to nearly 93% of kindergartners nationwide, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only Idaho and Alaska reported having lower vaccination rates against measles, though some states were missing data.

These fact prompted state health officials earlier this year [2025] to warn the state was at risk of a measles outbreak similar to the outbreak that occurred in Texas.

Wisconsin residents can check their vaccination status by visiting the Wisconsin Immunization Registry online and get up to date on the measles vaccine, known as the MMR vaccine, if they aren't already.

Second case of whooping cough confirmed in unvaccinated infant on Guam
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Public Health and Social Services has confirmed a 2nd case of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, among unvaccinated children on Guam in 2025. The latest case involves a 3-month-old infant reported on 29 Jul 2025.

Health officials have launched contact tracing and an epidemiologic investigation to identify the source of exposure. Pertussis is a highly contagious but vaccine-preventable respiratory disease that can cause severe coughing fits, vomiting, exhaustion, and in infants, life-threatening breathing complications.

""Preventing the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases like pertussis is essential to protecting public health,"" said DPHSS Chief Medical Officer Dr. Robert Leon Guerrero.

Residents are urged to ensure they and their children are up to date on vaccinations. DTaP and Tdap vaccines are available for eligible children through the DPHSS Vaccines for Children Program.

Whooping cough mysteriously packing a wallop in southern Utah in big numbers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Southwest Utah Public Health Department is reporting that the number of people who currently have whooping cough in Washington County is more than double the average number of people who get it all year. Pediatric doctors at St. George Regional Medical Center are seeing an increase in those with whooping cough, a respiratory bacterial infection that causes a wide variety of illnesses.

""I've seen admission, increased kids coming in and being hospitalized,"" said hospital pediatrician Dr. Kerri Smith. RedRock Pediatrics doctors Smith and Tim Larsen are seeing in person what the health department is showing in numbers. Washington County usually averages 10-15 cases of whooping cough per year. They said as of Friday [1 Aug 2025] there are 28 confirmed cases and 1 child in the hospital, along with 2 more in nearby Iron County.

Severe whooping cough occurs in non-inoculated children and infants. ""It's kind of considered one of those childhood diseases that has been vaccine-preventable now for decades,"" explained David Heaton with the Southwest Utah Public Health Department. ""Some people have suspicions, or maybe they've read some information about vaccines that gives them concerns.""

Heaton said the research is overwhelming, showing that while the vaccine is not 100% effective, it is very safe. He said there's less to worry about if a child is up to date on their Tdap, or tetanus, shots. Doctors now have concerns as school is about to get underway, and say it's important to get a child checked out as soon as they show symptoms of whooping cough, including pausing between breaths, lips turning blue, fainting and difficulty breathing.

And they said not to forget the sound of the cough, which you get in the 2-3 week mark and you're not feeling any better. ""There's a way to always make the illness milder when they do get it,"" said Heaton, ""and then getting treated early.""

Despite improvements in vaccination campaigns, challenges persist in certain areas, hindering immunization efforts. The government is planning additional campaigns to address these issues. A meeting was held to finalize strategies, and a new vaccination campaign is scheduled to begin, focusing on high-risk areas. Parents and communities are urged to support vaccination efforts to protect children.

<https://www.geo.tv/latest/617498-pakistans-polio-cases-rise-to-19-as-infant-infected-in-lakki-marwat>


Pakistan's total number of polio cases in 2025 has risen to 19 after a 5-month-old baby from Lakki Marwat district in South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa tested positive for the virus, health officials confirmed.

The latest case, reported from Union Council Sulemankhel, is the 12th infection detected in the province this year [2025], according to the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH).

The detection has reignited concerns for families in the region, where polio remains a persistent threat to young children despite ongoing eradication efforts.

Communities must understand that repeated vaccination is essential to protect every child against poliovirus, according to health officials.

Multiple doses are needed to build and maintain immunity. Every unvaccinated child remains at risk and may contribute to further transmission of the virus.

Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under 5 during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.

Despite significant improvements in the quality of polio vaccination campaigns nationwide, the southern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain a key area of concern due to restricted access, lack of female vaccinators, and operational challenges in conducting house-to-house vaccination.

These barriers continue to hinder immunisation efforts in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, leaving thousands of children unvaccinated.

Over the past year, the Pakistan PEI has achieved significant progress. Since September 2024, 6 high-quality immunisation campaigns, including 4 nationwide campaigns, have successfully reached over 45 million children each.

The National Emergency Operations Centre is planning to conduct 2 nationwide and 1 sub-national campaign between September and December 2025, in addition to targeted campaigns in selected high-risk districts.

These sustained efforts are essential to interrupt poliovirus transmission and protect children across the country.

A special high-level meeting was chaired by Chief Secretary KP, Shahab Ali Shah, in Peshawar on 2 and 3 Aug 2025.

District teams from South KP presented customised operational plans highlighting microplanning innovations, gap analyses, and strategies to overcome persistent challenges in high-risk areas.

After in-depth deliberations, a consensus roadmap was finalised, aligning district strategies with the provincial vision for a polio-free KP.

The next polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan will begin on 1 Sep 2025, with a special focus on high-risk and priority areas, including South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 

The campaign aims to vaccinate all children under the age of 5, quickly boosting their immunity and closing any gaps.

Parents and caregivers have been asked to ensure their children receive polio drops during this important campaign to help protect them from lifelong paralysis.

Polio eradication is a collective responsibility that requires unified efforts at all levels. While dedicated frontline polio workers continue to deliver life-saving vaccines, it is equally critical for parents and caregivers to ensure their children receive every dose of the polio vaccine.

Communities must play an active role by supporting vaccination efforts, dispelling misinformation, and encouraging others to protect their children through timely immunisation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During 2008-2019, 15 reported hepatitis B outbreaks in long-term care facilities were associated with assisted monitoring of blood glucose (AMBG) (1), a practice in which a person receives help from another person, such as a health care provider or other caregiver, to measure their blood glucose levels. CDC recommends assigning blood glucose monitors (glucometers) to one person (2). The North Carolina Division of Public Health (NCDPH) has messaging consistent with CDC recommendations. In May 2024, NCDPH was notified by the Surry County Health Department that a hospitalized patient aged 69 years had received a diagnosis of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection immediately after being transferred from a skilled nursing facility. The patient, who had diabetes, had been a resident at the nursing facility for 10 months. Diabetes management included AMBG.

The patient had no documented history of hepatitis B or hepatitis B vaccination and was hospitalized for an unrelated condition. However, viral hepatitis testing was ordered during admission because of symptoms consistent with acute hepatitis, including jaundice, nausea, and fatigue. Testing indicated an elevated liver transaminase level and positive results for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and immunoglobulin M antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc). The positive HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc results, in addition to a positive HBV DNA result, confirmed the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B. The North Carolina and Surry County health departments consulted with CDC to investigate potential HBV exposures, assess infection control practices at the skilled nursing facility, and determine the need for notifying and testing other residents at the facility. 

Investigation and Outcomes
--------------------------
An infection control assessment revealed that glucometers at the skilled nursing facility were shared among several residents and observed to be disinfected per manufacturer instructions between uses (2). No other gaps in infection control practices (e.g., nonadherence to standard precautions and breaches in injection safety) were observed during either of the 2 infection control assessment site visits.

North Carolina law requires that HBV infections be reported to NCDPH. To identify residents of the skilled nursing facility who had a previously reported HBV infection, NCDPH matched residents to HBV infection events in the North Carolina Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NC EDSS). No residents of the skilled nursing facility with a previously reported HBV infection were identified in NC EDSS. In mid-June 2024, all residents of the skilled nursing facility were tested for HBV infection to identify residents with a chronic HBV infection and who might have been the source of transmission for the patient with acute HBV infection. Testing received by residents included HBsAg, IgM anti-HBc, total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, and hepatitis B surface antibody. Residents who received a positive HBsAg result also received testing for HBV DNA. Hepatitis B testing identified a facility resident with a previously diagnosed and unreported chronic HBV infection who had lived at the skilled nursing facility since early 2022 and lived in a room close to that of the resident with acute HBV infection. The resident with chronic HBV infection received AMBG from November 2023 to February 2024, an interval that overlapped with the estimated incubation period for the patient with acute HBV infection (9-21 weeks before jaundice onset). AMBG records during March-April 2024 indicated that, during this period, both the resident with chronic HBV infection and the resident with acute HBV infection received daily AMBG from 1 of 2 devices located on a single medical cart, and the newly infected resident repeatedly underwent AMBG < 1 minute following the resident with chronic HBV infection, an interval that might not have allowed for adequate disinfection. The facility reported that no changes in AMBG policies or protocols occurred in the months preceding the March-April [2024] review period. Whole genome sequencing analysis demonstrated that the HBV strains infecting both residents were genetically identical.

Preliminary Conclusions and Actions
-----------------------------------
This report presents epidemiologic evidence that HBV infection in a skilled nursing facility was transmitted from a resident with chronic HBV infection to another resident through 2 shared glucometers. Even when disinfection protocols are followed, sharing equipment that is in contact with blood, such as glucometers, can present a risk for HBV transmission. Dedicating glucometers to a single resident and providing routine hepatitis B vaccination to residents with diabetes would reduce the risk for hepatitis B outbreaks in these settings.

In September 2024, NCDPH contacted all previously discharged residents whose time at the facility overlapped with that of the patient with chronic HBV infection. Notification letters sent by certified mail described the potential risk for HBV infection and recommended bloodborne pathogen testing. NC EDSS registry matches were conducted at 6 months and will be repeated at 12 months post-notification to identify any possible additional cases. As of March 2025, no additional cases had been identified.

Guidance from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends universal hepatitis B vaccination for persons aged < 60 years (3). Based on shared clinical decision making, ACIP also recommends hepatitis B vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 years at higher risk for hepatitis B, such as those with diabetes (3). Clinicians considering providing HBV vaccination to adults aged ≥ 60 years with diabetes should consider the risk posed by AMBG in skilled nursing facilities (4). Hepatitis B vaccination coverage remains low among persons aged ≥ 60 years with diabetes (5). The findings of this investigation highlight AMBG as a risk factor for HBV transmission and provide evidence that skilled nursing facilities might be an appropriate setting to offer hepatitis B vaccination.

At least 95 people in a village in Uttar Pradesh's Sitapur district have been detected with hepatitis B and C, recording an alarming rise in the infections, officials said. Dr Suresh Kumar, chief medical officer of Sitapur, said that 31 more people tested positive for hepatitis B and C on Tuesday [5 Aug 2025].

Preliminary investigations by health officials suggested that the likely cause of the outbreak in Sonsari village, which does not have a barber shop, is the unsafe shaving and hair-cutting practices followed by barbers coming from neighbouring villages. These barbers are suspected of using non-sterile blades and equipment, which could have resulted in the widespread transmission of blood-borne viruses, especially hepatitis B and C, said a health officer.

""There isn't a single barber shop in our village. Barbers are invited here every Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. Almost every male resident gets their shaving and haircut done by them,"" said village pradhan Shailendra Mishra.

He added that after medical officers informed them that the disease likely spread through the razors brought by barbers, the village formed 2 or 3 teams.

""These teams are working to convince residents to get their shaving and haircuts done at home using clean and personal tools, to lower the risk of infection,"" he said.

Medical authorities have urged residents to use new or properly sterilised tools for shaving and haircuts. They have launched an intensive screening and testing drive across Sonsari village for early detection and prevention of the spread of the infection.

According to officials, the infection was first reported last month [July 2025]when a few residents visited the Community Health Centre (CHC), Tambour, in Behta block for blood tests related to other health issues.

Dr Suresh Kumar said that the health department decided to conduct further testing when many villagers tested positive, and set up a medical camp, where more people were called in for blood screening.

Sonsari village, located around 50 km [31 mi] from the Sitapur district headquarters, has a population of around 3000, with farming being the primary occupation. A few residents have also migrated outside the district for work.

In the 2 medical camps organised recently, blood samples were collected from 400 residents and sent for testing.

""Out of these, 64 people were found positive for hepatitis B and C earlier. We are now working to collect and test blood samples from the entire village,"" said CMO.

Most of those who tested positive are not showing any symptoms, he added.

According to officials, hepatitis B and C spread through contact with infected blood or body fluids. This can happen through unprotected sex, sharing needles, using unsterilised medical or dental tools, sharing razors or blades, and unsafe tattooing or piercing.

The CMO said that while the exact cause of the hepatitis B and C outbreak in the village is yet to be confirmed, the suspected reason is the shared use of razors and blades during shaving and haircuts.

A team of physicians from the district hospital is also being sent to the village to assist with diagnosis and further investigation, said the CMO.

The medical department is also compiling detailed case histories of each infected individual, with special focus on men and women separately, to better understand the pattern of the outbreak.

The CMO further said that the blood samples of those who tested positive are being sent to King George's Medical University (KGMU) in Lucknow for viral load testing, which will help assess the severity of the infection in each case.

The health department is also planning to collect blood samples from neighbouring villages and is preparing a list of Sonsari residents who are currently working outside the district.

""Once the details of Sonsari residents currently living outside the district are collected, the list will be shared with the chief medical officers of the respective districts to ensure they are tested and to prevent any further spread of the infection,"" said the CMO.

MSF has mentioned that, since February 2025, its clinics in the area have registered more than 900 cases of measles, 300 of whom needed hospital admission.
 
 
 
 ""Just one week after the influx from Zamzam began, our teams have observed several suspected cases of measles among newly arrived children, indicating that the disease is beginning to spread within the displacement sites,"" MSF said in a statement.
 
 
 
 MSF revealed an increase in the number of children admitted to the intensive therapeutic feeding center, which treats children suffering from malnutrition and other co-morbidities. This center is attached to Tawila Hospital. An intensive measles vaccination campaign involving 18 000 children was also initiated in the area.

Emergency declared in Paraguay due to measles outbreak
------------------------------------------------------

Paraguay's Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare has issued an epidemiological alert due to a measles outbreak in the northern department of San Pedro. The measure was adopted after an initial case was confirmed in a 5-year-old boy, which has since led to 3 additional cases. All 4 confirmed patients were unvaccinated. The first victim was apparently in contact with people from abroad.

The ministry has deployed a National Rapid Response Team to the affected area, Santa Rosa del Aguaray, where the risk of spread is considered very high. The alert aims to strengthen health surveillance for febrile exanthematous disease (FED), encourage vaccination, and raise public awareness. Currently, the department of San Pedro has a notification rate of 5.0 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, according to the official report.

This outbreak is particularly concerning as it is the first since 2015, except for a single case in 2023 that did not result in secondary infections. The current vaccination coverage for measles in San Pedro is 74% for the first dose and 54% for the second, both of which are below the national and recommended levels.

The alert was issued due to the current epidemiological scenario, to urge health teams to strengthen surveillance of febrile exanthematous disease (FED), verify and complete vaccination schedules, and raise awareness among the population. The last outbreak of indigenous measles transmission in Paraguay occurred in 1998.

В 2025 году число случаев заболевания полиомиелитом в Пакистане достигло 19 из-за инфицирования детей в Лакки Марват
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
В 2025 году число случаев заболевания полиомиелитом в Пакистане достигло 19 из-за инфицирования младенцев в провинции Лакки Марват. Продолжающееся выявление случаев полиомиелита свидетельствует о сохраняющейся угрозе для детей, особенно в районах с низким уровнем охвата вакцинацией.
По информации представителей здравоохранения общее число случаев заболевания полиомиелитом в Пакистане в 2025 году возросло до 19 после того, как пятимесячный ребенок из района Лакки Марват в провинции Южная Хайбер-Пахтунхва получил положительный результат на вирус.
Несмотря на значительное улучшение качества кампаний вакцинации против полиомиелита по всей стране, южные районы провинции Хайбер-Пахтунхва остаются одной из основных проблемных областей из-за ограниченного доступа, нехватки вакцинаторов и трудностей с проведением вакцинации на дому. Эти барьеры по-прежнему препятствуют усилиям по иммунизации в южной части провинции Хайбер-Пахтунхва, в результате чего тысячи детей остаются невакцинированными.
С сентября 2024 года шестью кампаниями иммунизации, в том числе четырьмя общенациональными, было успешно охвачено более 45 миллионов детей.
Национальный центр чрезвычайных операций планирует провести две общенациональные и одну субнациональную кампанию в период с сентября по декабрь 2025 года, в дополнение к целевым кампаниям в отдельных районах высокого риска.
Следующая кампания вакцинации против полиомиелита в Пакистане начнется 1 сентября, при этом особое внимание будет уделено приоритетным районам высокого риска, включая Южную Хайбер-Пахтунхва. Кампания направлена на вакцинацию всех детей в возрасте до пяти лет, быстрое повышение их иммунитета и устранение любых пробелов.

LAX travelers potentially exposed to positive measles case
----------------------------------------------------------
Los Angeles County health officials are investigating a confirmed case of measles linked to an international traveler who was infectious while passing through LAX. The traveler arrived on China Airlines Flight 008 at the Tom Bradley International Terminal on 2 Aug 2025, officials said. Anyone who was in Terminal B between 9:30 p.m. 2 Aug 2025 and 12:35 a.m. 3 Aug 2025 may have been exposed. Any passengers who were seated next to this person on their flights will be notified of their exposure by local public health agencies.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health urges anyone potentially exposed to check their vaccination status, monitor for symptoms for 21 days, and stay home if they develop symptoms, which can include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. ""With measles outbreaks reported both in the United States and abroad, it is important for everyone to ensure they are fully vaccinated, especially before traveling,"" the department said.

Los Angeles County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis said measles is highly contagious through the air and on surfaces, and spreads particularly easily among those who are unvaccinated or have never had it in the past. ""Measles can lead to severe disease in young children and vulnerable adults. The best way to protect yourself and your family from infection is with the highly effective measles vaccine,"" Davis said.

San Diego teen who traveled brings home a case of measles
---------------------------------------------------------
San Diego County public health officials Friday [8 Aug 2025] confirmed the 1st case of measles in the region in a teenager who recently left the country. 

In 2024, 4 measles cases were confirmed in the county, all associated with international travel. As of 4 Aug 2025, a total of 19 cases have been reported in California. As of 6 Aug 2025, there are 1359 confirmed cases in the U.S.

The teenager testing positive for the disease was not vaccinated and may have exposed others at:
- Scripps Clinic Torrey Pines Urgent Care, 10710 North Torrey Pines Road, on 6 Aug 2025 from 8:53 p.m. to 7 Aug 2025 at 12:26 a.m.
- Rady Children's Emergency Department, 3020 Children's Way, 1st floor, on 6 Aug 2025 from 11:01 p.m. to 7 Aug 2025 at 05:21 a.m.

The county epidemiological team is working with Scripps and Rady to identify patients and staff who may have been exposed to the disease and to follow up on vaccination status.

""Measles is a very contagious disease that can be spread easily by coughing, sneezing or being in the same room with an infected person,"" said Dr. Ankita Kadakia, county deputy public health officer. ""Anyone who was at any of the specific locations and at the dates and times listed above should watch for symptoms and call their health care provider if they show any signs of the disease.""

As a precaution, people with symptoms are asked to call their doctor's office in advance, rather than visit an office directly.

Measles typically develops 7-21 days after exposure. Early symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. A distinctive red rash usually appears 1 to 4 days after early symptoms start. A person is considered contagious 4 days before and 4 days after the rash appears. The rash typically begins on the face and head, then proceeds downward and outward to the hands and feet. It fades in the same order it began, from head to feet.

""The best way to prevent measles is by getting the measles vaccine,"" Kadakia said. ""With measles outbreaks occurring in several countries, it is very important that all international travelers get vaccinated. Infants between 6 and 12 months of age who travel should get one dose, and travelers over 12 months of age should get 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart.""

Israeli Health Ministry reports 93 new diagnosed cases of measles
---------------------------------------------------------
The Israeli Health Ministry on Sunday [10 Aug 2025] reported 93 new diagnosed cases of measles, bringing the total in the current outbreak, which began in early April [2025], to 410. The ministry estimated that, due to the high hospitalization rate and community reports, the number of infected people in the current outbreak in Israel ranges from 950 to 1700.

According to the ministry, the number of active diagnosed patients has increased from 120 to 162, including 22 currently hospitalized. Two of the hospitalized patients, a one-year-old baby and a toddler nearly two-and-a-half years old, are currently receiving ECMO support in the intensive care unit.

About a month after the outbreak, the ministry launched a nationwide vaccination completion campaign, and since then, more than 105 000 doses have been administered.

Measles is an extremely contagious viral illness characterized by common symptoms, including fever, fatigue, runny nose, and a distinctive rash. In some cases, it can result in severe or potentially life-threatening complications.

Urgent epidemiological alert report: unprecedented diphtheria surge in Mogadishu
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Between June 2024 and August 2025, Mogadishu and surrounding districts experienced an unprecedented surge in diphtheria cases, escalating from 49 confirmed cases in 2024 to 497 in 2025, with deaths tripling from 13 to 42. De Martino Public Hospital, Somalia's primary referral institution, documented this alarming trend, noting that the outbreak disproportionately affected vulnerable groups -- particularly children and women -- and exposed gaps in vaccination coverage, early detection, and access to timely care. The report serves as both a technical analysis and a moral call for coordinated action from national, regional, and international health partners.

The findings reveal a 914% year-over-year increase in cases, with April 2025 marking the start of a steep rise that peaked in August. Mortality was notably higher among patients referred from home, highlighting the urgency of early hospital intervention. High-burden districts such as Karan, Yaqshiid, and Deyniile emerged as hotspots, demanding targeted vaccination campaigns and resource allocation. The report concludes that immediate, unified action -- combining vaccine outreach, medical supply distribution, technical support, and community education -- is essential to contain the outbreak and avert a wider public health crisis.

York Region Public Health says the confirmed case was on Air Canada Flight AC 8881, departing from Newark, New Jersey and landing in Toronto on July 30 [2025].

Anyone who boarded the flight from Newark around 5 p.m. and anyone who was at Person's Terminal 1 that evening between 7:30 and 11 p.m. may have been exposed to measles, officials said.  If you were on that flight, officials are asking people to fill out a contact survey with the identification number 2025034.

Health officials in Ontario say recent data [show] the number of new measles cases is down to single digits for the first time since January 2025. Since the outbreak began in October 2024, Ontario has reported more than 2300 infections.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. Symptoms can include fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes -- and can start from 7 to 21 days after exposure, officials say. A red rash can appear a few days after the first symptoms, starting in the head and neck and spreading down.

Officials say if you develop symptoms, call your doctor before seeing them and stay home. Officials say this case is separate from the one reported on August 1, 2025.

Hepatitis A cases in the Czech Republic reach 15-year high
----------------------------------------------------------

Hepatitis A cases in the Czech Republic have reached their highest level in 15 years, with infections rising sharply in Prague and surrounding regions. Health experts are warning of further spread and advising the public to maintain strict hand hygiene and consider vaccination.

By the end of July 2025, more than 1000 cases had been recorded nationwide -- a figure not seen since 2009. In comparison, just 636 infections were reported during the whole of 2024, according to the National Institute of Public Health (SZÚ). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) had already issued a warning in June 2025 about outbreaks in Central Europe, with Slovakia, Austria and Hungary also reporting elevated numbers.

The virus is primarily transmitted through contaminated hands that have come into contact with tiny traces of feces. It can survive for several hours on skin and for days on objects. Outbreaks often occur in nurseries, schools and other places with large gatherings.

According to the news channel ČT24, Prague has reported the highest number of cases (370), followed by the Central Bohemian Region (181) and the Moravian-Silesian Region (113).

Early symptoms often mimic flu, including fever, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain and general malaise. Later signs of liver inflammation may develop, such as yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark urine, pale stools and itching. Strikingly, 9 in 10 infected people show no symptoms at all, yet the virus remains highly transmissible when hygiene guidelines are not observed.

To contain the spread, the SZÚ is focusing on targeted vaccinations for homeless people and other at-risk groups, as well as post-exposure jabs for those in contact with infected individuals. Experts also recommend vaccination for the wider population. The course consists of 2 doses and costs around 1700 Czech crowns [~USD 81], which recipients currently have to pay for themselves.

Health officials: Unvaccinated North Idaho child is state's 1st resident measles case since 2023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
North Idaho health officials on Tuesday [12 Aug 2025] identified the state's 1st confirmed measles infection in a resident since 2023. The case was reported amid the nation's worst outbreak of the disease in decades. The Panhandle Health District reported the case was an unvaccinated child in Kootenai County; the confirmation of the infection marked the 1st case in the state's Panhandle area since 1991, according to a press release from the health district. 

Health officials last week reported that the measles virus was detected in wastewater in Coeur d'Alene, indicating someone in the area was infected, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 

Measles is a highly contagious virus and spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, the Panhandle Health District press release said. The virus can stay in the air 2 hours after an infected person has left. Symptoms typically appear 7 to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash. While many recover without problems, measles can lead to serious complications, especially in very young children and people with weakened immune systems.

Cases of the disease nationwide reported in 2025 have already surpassed the total number of cases in 2024, the release said. Measles has been reported in 41 jurisdictions, including in Washington, Montana, Oregon and Wyoming. Among those cases, 13% have been hospitalized, most of them children, the release said. State health officials also previously reported that a child from another country visiting eastern Idaho had measles, the Sun reported. 

""The measles vaccine is highly effective, and for most people, 2 childhood doses of vaccine is all they will ever need to protect themselves against measles for their lifetime,"" the release said. The MMR vaccine is typically given between 12 and 15 months of age followed by another dose at 4 to 6 years of age. It can be given as early as 6 months of age for those who are traveling to areas with known measles infections or in the event of a local outbreak of measles, the release said.

The virus's serious complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain) and, in rare cases, death. A high fever, cough, runny nose, rash and red, watery eyes are common measles symptoms, the CDC, says. 

There is no antiviral treatment for measles, according to the CDC. People with measles symptoms should not enter health care settings without calling ahead, and should contact their health care providers. People exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure.

2-year-old dies of measles in outbreak's first fatality
---------------------------------------
The Health Ministry reports the death of a 2-year-old boy who contracted measles. The unvaccinated boy had been hospitalized and was on a life-support system for several weeks.

Since a measles outbreak began in Israel about 3 months ago, 503 patients have been diagnosed, of whom 187 are active patients. Most of the patients diagnosed recently are from the Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh areas. As of today [13 Aug 2025], 12 children are hospitalized, all under the age of 6. Three are in intensive care, and one is on life support. Ten of these children are unvaccinated, and 2 cases are still being investigated.

The ministry urges parents to complete their routine vaccinations, especially the measles vaccine. Vaccination status is available in the digital vaccination registry on the government's website. Additional information and instructions can be found on the ministry's website.

An 18-month-old unvaccinated toddler who died of measles in Jerusalem in 2018 was Israel's first recorded measles fatality in 15 years. The girl was one of 3 Israelis who died of measles during the 2018-2019 outbreak.

Restaurant reopens after virus scare
------------------------------
Oslo's historic Frognerseteren Restaurant and its busy café were back in business this week, scrubbed and cleared by local health authorities. They had tied the restaurant to an ongoing outbreak of the hepatitis A virus, and now Oslo's blood bank is also taking steps to prevent blood donors from spreading the virus further.

The restaurant is best known for its classic timber architecture, traditional food, and sweeping views over the Norwegian capital. It ran into trouble earlier this month [August 2025], though, when Oslo health authorities found a common link among local residents falling ill with the hepatitis A virus: All had eaten at Frognerseteren earlier this summer.

The number of confirmed cases is now over 30 and likely to keep climbing, since an estimated 20 000 people visited the restaurant between mid-June and 1 Aug [2025], when the restaurant voluntarily closed. Not only was eating at the restaurant a common link among those infected with hepatitis, food safety officials from the state agency Mattilsynet had shown up for a surprise inspection.

The state regulators were alarmed by what they found. Norwegian Broadcasting (NRK) ran photos from Mattilsynet (external link to NRK, in Norwegian) of a filthy vent over a cooking area, a pot of chocolate warming up next to dirty dishes and a sink where employees washed their hands, and mildew growing on the ceiling and walls of a storage room. The inspectors also reported that the storage/technical room was full of spiders and dirty utensils, and claimed that they'd observed how workers in the kitchen failed to wash their hands with soap.

Restaurant manager Stig Furuseth quickly apologized for the situation and told NRK that all violations found had been corrected. He claimed that the absence of regular staff during the summer holidays and temporary personnel hired in to replace them had resulted in ""internal routines not being followed well enough."" He said last week that all of the restaurant's permanent employees were now back at work, ""and we can guarantee that all routines will be followed to their fullest.""

The restaurant, a local landmark for the past 134 years, could thus reopen 2 weeks after the violations were confirmed. Furuseth claimed it had been ""a demanding time, but we have used it to make sure that Frognerseteren is now safer than ever."" He said all employees had been vaccinated against hepatitis and cleared by health officials, that all food on hand had been destroyed, and that the entire restaurant had undergone a thorough cleaning aimed at preventing infection.

Health officials remain concerned that more people will fall ill, however, because of the virus' long incubation time. While news of the hepatitis outbreak has spread in Oslo and around the country, the local health officials are also concerned about visitors from abroad who may have eaten at Frognerseteren this summer and taken the virus home with them. They're difficult to track down and warn.

The Oslo Blood Bank, meanwhile, is taking steps to stem further infection locally through blood transfusions. They're asking all their blood donors in Oslo to contact them if they'd eaten at Frognerseteren between 15 Jun and 2 Aug [2025]. Since it can take up to 6 weeks from the time of infection until those infected fall ill, the blood bank wants donors who have visited Frognerseteren to wait at least 6 weeks since their visit before donating blood. Any blood donors who have contracted the virus, or live with someone who is infected with hepatitis, must wait more than 6 months before giving blood again.

10 countries in the Americas report measles outbreaks in 2025
---------------------------------------------------------
The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is urging countries in the Americas to strengthen immunization activities and enhance disease surveillance and rapid response interventions as measles cases continue to rise in the region. As of 8 Aug 2025, a total of 10 139 confirmed measles cases and 18 related deaths have been reported across 10 countries, representing a 34-fold increase compared to the same period in 2024.

The outbreaks are linked primarily to low vaccination coverage, with 71% of cases occurring in unvaccinated individuals and a further 18% in people whose vaccination status is unknown. In 2024, coverage with the first dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in the region reached 89% (2 percentage points higher than in 2023), while the second dose increased from 76% to 79%. However, these levels remain below the 95% recommended to prevent outbreaks.

""Measles is preventable with 2 doses of a vaccine, which is proven to be very safe and effective. To stop these outbreaks, countries must urgently strengthen routine immunization and conduct targeted vaccination campaigns in high-risk communities,"" said Dr. Daniel Salas, executive manager of the Special Program for Comprehensive Immunization at PAHO.

Countries with the highest case numbers include Canada (4548 cases), Mexico (3911 cases), and the USA (1356 cases). Other countries reporting confirmed cases are Bolivia (229), Argentina (35), Belize (34), Brazil (17), Paraguay (4), Peru (4), and Costa Rica (1). Paraguay is the latest country to report an outbreak in 2025. Deaths have been reported in Mexico (14), USA (3), and Canada (1). In Mexico, most deaths have occurred in indigenous people between 1 and 54 years of age. Canada reported a fatal congenital measles infection in a newborn.

The current outbreaks are associated with 2 genotypes of the measles virus. One genotype has been identified in outbreaks across 8 countries, particularly among Mennonite communities in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Belize, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. Given that measles is a highly contagious viral disease, it spreads rapidly among unvaccinated populations, especially children. However, recent data suggests an increasing number of cases outside of these groups.

Country highlights
-------------
In Canada, national trends shows that transmission is persisting, particularly in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario, following an outbreak that began in New Brunswick in October 2024.

In Mexico, a mass vaccination campaign targeting people aged 6 months to 49 years is underway in 14 priority municipalities that have active measles transmission in Chihuahua, which accounts for 93% of the country's cases. Indigenous communities have been hardest hit, with a case-fatality rate 20 times higher than in the general population.

The USA has reported outbreaks in 41 [now 42 - Mod.LL] jurisdictions, mainly among under-vaccinated Mennonite populations, though no new cases have been reported in Texas or New Mexico since late July [2025].

In Bolivia, most cases are concentrated in Santa Cruz, with additional cases reported in 7 other departments, affecting both the general population and Mennonite communities.

Argentina and Belize have seen no new cases since late June [2025].

Brazil has reported 16 cases in Tocantins, linked to the regional outbreak and affecting members of a small Russian Orthodox community.

PAHO response and recommendations
--------------------------
PAHO is providing direct technical cooperation across the region to support surveillance, case investigation, outbreak response, laboratory diagnostics, and vaccination efforts. This includes deploying experts to countries such as Mexico, Argentina, and Bolivia; monitoring importation risks in Brazil and Paraguay; strengthening surveillance systems; and working with communities and health workers to counter misinformation and promote vaccine uptake.

The organization urges countries to
- achieve and sustain high immunization coverage (at least 95% with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine),
- reinforce rapid response systems to contain outbreaks quickly,
- scale up vaccination strategies from selective approaches (such as ring or mop-up vaccination) to mass campaigns in outbreak and high-risk areas, based on the epidemiological situation and population movement,
- ensure timely detection and laboratory confirmation of cases, and
- engage at-risk communities to improve health literacy and address vaccine hesitancy.

PAHO does not recommend travel restrictions but advises travelers to ensure they are vaccinated, especially when visiting areas with active outbreaks. This includes children aged 6 to 11 months, who are not usually covered by routine immunization programs but should receive early protection in outbreak contexts.

Regional and global context
----------------
The Americas interrupted endemic transmission of measles in 2016, a milestone unique at the global level. Although endemic transmission reappeared in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019, both countries regained their elimination status in 2023 and 2024, respectively. However, keeping measles at bay in the Americas remains a challenge, as the virus continues to circulate widely in other parts of the world, and vaccine-hesitant groups are spread throughout the region.

Globally, surveillance data from the World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded 239 816 suspected cases and 108 074 confirmed cases in all WHO Regions, as of July 2025. The Eastern Mediterranean Region accounts for the highest share (35%), followed by the African Region (21%) and the European Region (21%).

The Health Ministry reports the death of an 18-month-old toddler who contracted measles.

The unvaccinated boy arrived at the emergency room of a hospital in Jerusalem after being ill at home for several days.

This follows the death from measles of a 2-year-old unvaccinated boy on Wednesday [13 Aug 2025].

Since the measles outbreak began in Israel about 3 months ago, as of last Thursday [14 Aug 2025], 526 cases of measles have been diagnosed, of which 209 are active cases. 

Most of the recently diagnosed patients are from the Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh area, with most of the hospitalized patients being unvaccinated children.

As of last Thursday [14 Aug 2025], 19 children are still hospitalized, all under the age of 6. Two of the children are in intensive care, and one is still connected to a life-support system.

The ministry urges parents to complete their routine vaccinations, especially the measles vaccine.

Measles outbreak in Darfur due to low vaccination coverage
----------------------------------------------------------

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) [Doctors Without Borders] revealed on Wednesday [11 June 2025] a massive outbreak of measles in 4 of the 5 states in Darfur region, western Sudan, due to a decline in vaccination campaigns.

The first wave of cases appeared in Rokero, north of Jebel Marra in Central Darfur State, in June 2024, after a routine vaccination campaign, organized by the Ministry of Health, was halted due to the [armed] conflict and the Rapid Support Forces' control of most of the region.

In a statement received by Sudan Tribune, MSF said it had detected measles cases in East Jebel Marra of South Darfur, Forobaranga in West Darfur, Zalingei in Central Darfur, Sortoni [IDP] camp in North Darfur, and Tina in [the neighboring] eastern Chad [region].

MSF attributed the spread of measles to low vaccination coverage, calling for intensified efforts to vaccinate children. MSF also noted that the administrative obstacles and the blockage of supply routes since the conflict broke out in the country, have led to vaccine shortages in Darfur region and disrupted routine vaccination programs in several locations for months.

The organization cited the example of the complete suspension of vaccination services in Sortoni camp, which shelters over 55 000 displaced people, from May 2024 to February 2025. MSF has carried out several vaccination campaigns in Darfur region, including one last November [2024] in North Jebel Marra, excluding children over the age of 5 due to vaccine shortages.

The organization is supporting vaccination campaigns that are currently implemented by the Ministry of Health, which have successfully administered measles vaccine to 55 800 children in Forobaranga, while another 93 000 children are expected to receive the vaccine in North Jebel Marra and Sortony camp by the end of this week.

The statement revealed that, in the period from June 2024 to May 2025, MSF treated more than 9950 measles patients in facilities it manages or supports, including nearly 2700 cases that required hospitalization.

It noted that the organization had to expand the capacity of pediatric beds in 3 hospitals due to the continuous influx of measles patients.

Sue Bucknell, MSF's deputy head of mission in West Darfur, said that 30% of measles patients in Forobaranga are over the age of 5, and 5% of them have received the vaccine, indicating that the lack of vaccination was there before the current conflict broke out.

She explained that measles is not the only infectious disease prevalent in Darfur, as MSF-supported facilities have received nearly 200 suspected cholera cases in other 2 states in Darfur.

For her part, Cecilia Greco, MSF's medical coordinator in Central Darfur State, noted that the ongoing conflict is contributing to the expansion of the measles outbreak, as it limits the ability of medical key players to prevent and respond to infectious diseases. She also noted that the mass displacement of populations is further complicating the situation as it has led to the rapid spread of measles across the region.

She called for the cooperation of federal and local health authorities and UN agencies to vaccinate children and enhance their efficient rapid response in the event of further outbreaks, such as cholera in Darfur. In this connection, it is noteworthy that most areas of Darfur have witnessed waves of displacement due to the conflict which has been concentrated this year in North Darfur state.

<https://en.goobjoog.com/somalia-records-sharp-rise-in-diphtheria-cases-amid-aid-cuts-and-vaccine-shortages/>


Somalia has recorded a steep increase in diphtheria cases and deaths this year [2025], with health officials warning that vaccine shortages and cuts in international aid are fueling the outbreak.

The National Institute of Health said more than 1600 cases and 87 deaths have been confirmed in 2025. In comparison, the country registered 838 cases and 56 deaths throughout 2024.

Diphtheria is a bacterial disease that mostly affects children, causing throat swelling, fever, and difficulty in breathing. It is preventable through vaccination, but hundreds of thousands of Somali children remain unvaccinated despite improvements in immunization rates over the past decade.

Families fleeing conflict are among the hardest hit. [DMA], who escaped fighting in central Somalia 3 months ago, said all 4 of her children contracted diphtheria. Her 9-year-old daughter recovered, but her 8-year-old son died, while 2 younger children are currently being treated in Mogadishu.

Health Minister Ali Haji Adam blamed the worsening outbreak on global vaccine shortages and aid cuts, particularly from the United States.

""The US aid cut terribly affected health funding. Many health centres closed, and mobile vaccination teams lost funding,"" he said. US support dropped to USD 149 million this fiscal year, down from USD 765 million last year.

The US State Department, however, said Washington continues to provide lifesaving assistance and urged other countries to step up support.

Humanitarian agencies, including Save the Children, reported that the closure of hundreds of clinics has left communities vulnerable. They say diphtheria, measles, whooping cough, cholera, and severe respiratory infections have all surged since April [2025].

Other major donors, such as the UK, France, and Germany, have also reduced aid budgets in recent years.

Meanwhile, the Somali government, which allocated just 4.8% of its 2024 budget to health, has announced plans to launch a new vaccination drive, although no start date has been given.

Suspected case of measles in a child from Chisinau
----------------------------------------------
A case of measles has been reported in a child from Chisinau who had received the first dose of the vaccine.

""The patient is out of any danger, and the results of the laboratory tests are pending,"" mentioned the deputy head of the General Directorate of Medical and Social Assistance, Vladimir Bolocan, at the operational meeting at the City Hall, reports IPN.

According to Bolocan, the minor has been vaccinated with the first dose, but a complete vaccination cycle is needed to achieve stable immunity, and even though the risk of infection decreases after the first dose, it does not completely disappear.

Bolocan also reported that the situation with infectious diseases remains problematic in the capital. There have been 597 cases of such diseases reported, which is an increase of over 20% compared to the previous week. Approximately 43% of the illnesses were recorded in patients from 0 to 17 years old, the vast majority of whom are hospitalized.

Local authorities recommend that adults monitor their children's health in order to detect certain infections early and prevent their spread when children return to school after the new school year begins.

[In the following press release from Tuesday (10 Jun 2025), the non-governmental organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) warned of a measles vaccines shortage in most states of Darfur region.]

For a year now, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams in Darfur, Sudan, have been witnessing outbreaks of measles in the 4 Darfur states where we currently work. While massive vaccination campaigns are finally ongoing in several locations across the region, MSF calls on health authorities and medical organisations to increase efforts to catch up on the immunisation of children who have never been vaccinated.

The first surge of measles cases observed and treated by MSF were in June 2024 in Rokero, in Central Darfur, where MSF teams have been running the local Ministry of Health hospital since 2020. At the start of 2025, cases were also reported in East Jebel Marra, South Darfur, and in Forbrenga, West Darfur. More recently, new surges are also being observed in Zalengei, Sortony, and in Tine, East Chad -- all places where we run activities.

From June 2024 until the end of May 2025, more than 9950 patients were treated for measles in health facilities run or supported by MSF in the region. Around 2700 were complicated cases requiring hospitalisation, and 35 deaths were recorded. To manage the influx of patients, we had to expand our paediatric bed capacity in 3 hospitals.

One of the root causes of this situation is the region's already low immunisation coverage.

""In Forbrenga, 30% of the measles patients we are receiving are above 5 years but only 5% of them are vaccinated,"" says Sue Bucknell, deputy head of mission in West Darfur. ""This suggests that the lack of vaccination dates back further than the recent conflict.""

""The ongoing conflict is also contributing to this outbreak, constraining the capacities of medical staff to both prevent and respond to outbreaks of contagious diseases,"" says Dr Cecilia Greco, medical coordinator for Central Darfur. ""Mass population displacement has made the illness spread even faster across the region, further complicating the situation.""

Since the war broke out, constant administrative impediments and regular blockades of key supply roads have caused vaccine shortages throughout Darfur. This led to disruption in routine immunisation programmes in several locations, sometimes for months. In Sortony, for example, an internally displaced people’s camp in North Darfur hosting more than 55 000 people, vaccination activities totally stopped from May 2024 to February 2025.

These constraints and shortages have also limited medical organisations’ capacity to roll out proper response campaigns. Last year [2024], MSF carried out several vaccination campaigns, such as in November 2024 in North Jebel Marra where 9600 children were vaccinated. 

However, due to limited vaccine supplies, our teams were forced to reduce the target number and to exclude children over age 5, despite clear needs. This inevitably reduced the long-term impact of these campaigns. In North Jebel Marra, while the vaccination campaign initially slowed the outbreak, cases began to rise sharply again from February [2025].

Although mass vaccination campaigns are now happening in different parts of Darfur, negotiations and procedures have been lengthy. After MSF first raised the alarm about the multiple surges our teams were witnessing, it took months before the Federal Ministry of Health in Port Sudan and UNICEF released the needed vaccines from their stocks, finally enabling mass vaccination campaigns to be launched in different areas of Darfur.

Last week, 55 800 children from age 9 months to 15 years were vaccinated in Forbrenga as part of a campaign led by the Ministry of Health and supported by MSF. Around 93 000 more children are set to receive the vaccine in North Jebel Marra and Sortony by the end of this week, in a similar campaign.

Health Ministry says it has tracked 618 measles cases since outbreak began 3 months ago
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Health Ministry reports that 618 cases of measles have been diagnosed since the measles outbreak began in Israel about 3 months ago, including 236 active cases, with most hospitalized patients being unvaccinated children. Two unvaccinated infants with no underlying conditions have died from measles in the past week.

There are 21 patients now hospitalized, most of them children under the age of 6, along with one adult. Two patients are in intensive care, and 1 is connected to a life-support system.

The ministry also says that a measles patient traveled on public transportation on the Bnei Brak-Beit Shemesh bus line (line 681) during the contagious period of the disease. On 15 Aug 2025, they took a bus from Bnei Brak to Beit Shemesh between 15:00-16:30, and on the following 2 days, they took the bus from Beit Shemesh to Bnei Brak between 23:30-00:45. People who were near the measles patient at the above times and locations are advised to ensure that they are vaccinated according to the Ministry's recommendations.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease characterized by fever, malaise, a runny nose, and a rash. Infection can lead to dangerous complications such as blindness, pneumonia, brain swelling and death. Vaccination status can be checked through the government personal portal using the digital vaccination record.

Whooping cough outbreak confirmed; 16 suspected cases, 3 in critical care
------------------------------------------------------------
Enhanced surveillance is underway in Vanuatu as the Ministry of Health (MOH) confirms an outbreak of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough. Daily data collection from hospitals and community sites shows that out of 16 suspected cases, 8 patients are currently in isolation, 3 are in critical condition, and one is stable under treatment; 4 patients are pending discharge.

Over the past 2 weeks, the Ministry has recorded a sharp increase in suspected cases of this highly contagious respiratory disease. Laboratory testing has confirmed that 7 out of 8 samples submitted to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) in Australia tested positive for _Bordetella pertussis_, the bacterium responsible for whooping cough. All confirmed cases involved unvaccinated children under the age of 5, highlighting the urgent need to strengthen immunization coverage across affected communities.

In response, the MOH has officially declared a whooping cough outbreak and is calling on all parents and guardians to ensure that their children's vaccinations are up to date. Authorities emphasise that suspected cases should be treated promptly with [antimicrobials]. Families are urged to protect children and pregnant women by avoiding close contact with suspected cases, practicing regular handwashing, wearing masks, and avoiding crowded areas.

The Ministry is also urging families with unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children under the age of 5 to bring them to the nearest health facility without delay. Parents and caregivers are advised to seek medical attention immediately for symptoms such as persistent cough, fever, or breathing difficulties. Travellers returning from Tanna are being asked to monitor their health closely and seek medical care if they or their children become unwell. Early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics are critical in reducing severity and preventing transmission.

Pertussis is a serious respiratory illness caused by _Bordetella pertussis_. It is known for severe coughing fits followed by a ""whoop"" sound during inhalation. The disease is especially dangerous for infants and young children. It spreads easily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and close contact significantly increases the risk of infection.

Symptoms typically appear within 7 to 10 days, but in some cases may take up to 21 days to develop. They include mild fever, runny nose, and a persistent cough that can progress into severe coughing fits accompanied by the characteristic ""whoop."" Children may also vomit after coughing. In infants, coughing may not be evident, but difficulty breathing or feeding may indicate infection.

Unvaccinated individuals remain at the highest risk of contracting whooping cough, particularly infants, young children, and pregnant women, who may also pass the disease to their newborns. Treatment involves the use of [antibacterials], and suspected cases are advised to avoid contact with infants, young children, and pregnant women until at least 5 days of treatment have been completed.

Vaccination remains the most effective method of prevention. The Pentavalent vaccine is strongly recommended for all infants and children, and parents are encouraged to ensure their children have received the full schedule of immunisations. Preventive measures also include regular handwashing, proper respiratory etiquette, avoiding contact with infected individuals, and seeking medical care promptly.

According to the director general of the National Institute of Health, Somalia, more than 1600 cases of diphtheria with 87 deaths have been recorded so far, compared to 838 cases and 56 deaths in the year 2024.

The Somali Minister of Health Ali Haji Adam, said the government is facing difficulties in obtaining sufficient vaccines due to the global shortage of vaccines plus the current reduction in funding by USA has its impact on the mobile teams that distribute the vaccines in remote areas plus the closure of clinics.

Last month [July 2025], the NGO Save the Children said that the closure of hundreds of health clinics in Somalia this year, because of the aid discounts, has contributed to the multiplication of cases of diphtheria, measles, whooping cough, cholera, and acute respiratory infections since mid-April 2025.

Next to the United States, Britain, France, Germany and other great western donors have reduced their aid budgets. The Somali government also faced criticism from doctors and human rights activists due to its poor financing to the health sector, and according to Amnesty International the Somali government allocated 4.8% of its budget to health in 2024, decreasing from 8.5% in the previous year [2023].

Abstract
--------
Background: _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ is an emerging zoonotic pathogen capable of causing diphtheria-like infections in humans. Objectives: we report, for the 1st time in Brazil, the detection and phenotypic/genomic characterization of 3 atoxigenic ST-339 strains isolated from domestic animals, including one with a ciprofloxacin resistance profile linked to double GyrA mutations (S89L, D93G). 

Methods: species identification was performed by MALDI-TOF MS, followed by in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses to predict virulence determinants, antimicrobial resistance genes, CRISPR-Cas systems, mobile genetic elements, and in silico structural analysis as well as phylogenetic reconstruction. 

Results: whole-genome sequencing confirmed species identity, revealed high genetic similarity, and identified distinct phylogenetic subclades, suggesting potential international dissemination. Genomic analyses showed conserved virulence determinants, such as incomplete pilus clusters, iron acquisition systems, and the _pld_ gene, with the absence of the _tox_ gene. Molecular modeling and dynamics simulations indicated that GyrA mutations disrupt critical ciprofloxacin-magnesium-water interactions, reducing binding stability. Mobile genetic elements, prophages, and CRISPR-Cas systems underscored the genomic plasticity of these isolates. 

Conclusions: these findings document a little-studied antimicrobial resistance mechanism in zoonotic _C. ulcerans_, highlighting the need for strengthened surveillance and further research on virulence and resistance, even in atoxigenic strains.

The new schedule continues in this tradition. It differs from recent recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the CDC, which was overhauled in 2025 and replaced with individuals who have a history of spreading vaccine misinformation.

""The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children, and adolescents,"" said AAP President Susan J. Kressly, MD, FAAP. ""Pediatricians know how important routine childhood immunizations are in keeping children, families, and their communities healthy and thriving.""

The schedule represents formal recommendations from the AAP for routine immunizations for infants, children, and adolescents against 18 diseases. The schedule published includes updated recommendations for RSV, influenza, and COVID-19 immunizations for pediatric populations.

In addition to the updated recommendations for the 3 respiratory viruses, the schedule incorporates recent updates regarding pentavalent meningococcal vaccine, the starting age of the human papilloma virus vaccine, and removal of a hepatitis vaccine that is no longer available.

""The AAP urges every insurer to cover all the vaccines that are included in this immunization schedule,"" Dr. Kressly said. ""AAP is committed to working with our partners at the local, state, and federal levels to make sure every child, in every community, has access to vaccines.""

AAP will also publish a parent-friendly immunization schedule on <HealthyChildren.org>.

RSV
----
RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) is the leading cause of hospitalization for babies before their first birthday. It is a virus that affects the lungs and airways and spreads easily through the air and by physical contact with the germs. Immunizations for pregnant mothers and newborns provide antibodies that offer necessary protection.

""Babies who become infected with RSV can get much sicker than older kids because their lungs and airways are so tiny,"" said Kristina Bryant, MD, FAAP, a member of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. ""There are 2 ways to help your baby get ahead of this serious respiratory illness. Moms who get the RSV vaccine during their pregnancy can pass important antibodies to their developing baby through the placenta. Or new babies can get an RSV shot for RSV season. Well-timed RSV immunizations help babies stay healthy.""

Nirsevimab and clesrovimab are the recommended immunizations to prevent RSV. Both are monoclonal antibody products, which are given to babies for instant protection. Another monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, is a shorter-acting product that is no longer recommended for use.

The AAP recommends the following:
- Immunization for infants younger than 8 months who are born during or entering their first RSV season if the pregnant parent did not receive vaccine during pregnancy, if the vaccination status is unknown, or if the infant was born less than 14 days after the pregnant parent received the vaccine.
- Immunization for infants and children 8 through 19 months of age at high risk of severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season. High-risk infants include children with chronic lung disease, immunocompromise, or cystic fibrosis, as well as other groups.

The Academy's recommendations for RSV immunizations are published online (<https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073923/203221/Recommendations-for-the-Prevention-of-RSV-Disease>) and will be published in the November issue of Pediatrics (online 19 Aug 2025).

Influenza
-------
AAP recommends annual flu vaccines for all children starting at 6 months old, unless they have a medical reason not to be immunized. This helps protect not only the child but also the community -- especially during seasons when other viruses like RSV and COVID-19 are also circulating. The Academy's flu vaccine recommendations (<https://tinyurl.com/49fjcfnp>) and an accompanying technical report (<https://tinyurl.com/2h3wbent>) were pre-published on 28 Jul 2025 in Pediatrics and will be published in the October 2025 print issue.

""The flu can be much more serious than just a cold or run-of-the-mill viral infection, especially for children under the age of 5 or those with conditions like asthma or diabetes. It is also something that kids can catch -- and spread -- easily. An annual influenza immunization helps your child's immune system recognize and resist the virus so they can stay in school, go on playdates, and do the things kids love doing,"" Dr. Bryant said.

Influenza (or the flu) is a viral infection of the nose, throat, and lungs. It spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes and another person breathes in the virus from the air, or when someone touches a contaminated surface then puts a finger in their mouth or nose.

Children who are hospitalized, have serious or worsening flu symptoms, or have health conditions that put them at higher risk for complications should start antiviral treatment for the flu as soon as possible, even if they've been sick for a few days.

The 2024-2025 influenza season was a high-severity season for persons of all ages, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC reported 267 influenza-related pediatric deaths through 2 Aug 2025. Of those, 43.6% occurred in children without a high-risk medical condition.

Historically, up to 80% of influenza-associated pediatric deaths have occurred in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated children. Children younger than 5 years, especially those less than 2 years, are especially vulnerable to severe illness and hospitalizations or death due to influenza.

COVID
------
COVID-19 continues to result in hospitalization and death in the pediatric population. Infants and children 6 through 23 months of age are at the highest risk for severe COVID-19. Given this, the AAP recommends a COVID-19 vaccine for all children ages 6 through 23 months old to help protect against serious illness. Children younger than 2 years old are especially vulnerable to severe COVID-19 and should be prioritized for vaccination unless they have a known allergy to the vaccine or its ingredients.

In addition to the recommendation for all children younger than 2 years, the AAP recommends a single dose of age-appropriate COVID-19 vaccine for all children and adolescents 2 through 18 years of age in the following risk groups:
- persons at high risk of severe COVID-19
- residents of long-term care facilities or other congregate settings
- persons who have never been vaccinated against COVID-19
- persons whose household contacts are at high risk for severe COVID-19

The AAP also recommends the vaccine be available for children ages 2-18 who do not fall into these risk groups, but whose parent or guardian desires them to have the protection of the vaccine. The most updated version of the COVID-19 vaccine that is available should be used. The Academy's recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines are published online (<https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073924/203222/Recommendations-for-COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants>) and will be published in the November issue of Pediatrics (online 19 Aug 2025).

""We extensively reviewed the most recently available data about COVID-19 risks in kids, as well as safety and effectiveness of available COVID-19 vaccines. It's clear they are very safe for all populations. Among the reasons we decided to move to a risk-based recommendation for healthy older children is the fact that the hospitalization rate for young children and children with underlying medical conditions remains high, in line with rates for many of the other vaccine-preventable diseases for which we vaccinate,"" said Sean O'Leary, MD, FAAP, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases.

An outbreak of measles has been reported in Malindi Sub-County, amid concerns over low childhood immunisation coverage that local health officials warn could expose the community to more epidemics.

At least 4 children have been reported to have contracted measles in the Shella area of Malindi town, with health officials saying they are conducting a mop-up exercise and administering repeat measles vaccine doses to those who may have missed out in the recent campaign.

Sub-county Public Health Officer Alex Maitha said, despite recent vaccination campaigns, a significant number of children have not received the recommended 2 doses of the measles-rubella vaccine.

""Our immunisation coverage is very low, and we are already witnessing a measles outbreak in Malindi, with several cases reported. We are conducting mop-up exercises, moving door-to-door and to schools to give booster doses where children have missed out,"" Maitha said.

Speaking during an immunisation sensitisation workshop for community leaders at a Malindi hotel, Maitha noted that while the government-led campaign on measles, rubella, and typhoid vaccines had improved coverage slightly, the targets were not met.

""If children do not get vaccinated as required, we face the real danger of frequent outbreaks of preventable diseases,"" he cautioned.

Meanwhile, the officer warned about the spread of Mpox, citing 2 samples taken for analysis in Kilifi County and 140 cases registered in neighbouring Mombasa County.

""Mpox spreads quickly through skin contact. If a vaccine is introduced, we must embrace it, knowing that we are already facing an outbreak,"" he added.

On the other hand, Sub-county Nursing Services Coordinator Esther Kasichana echoed the concern, pointing out that uptake of the HPV vaccine against cervical cancer in Malindi stands at less than 10%.

""This performance is not good. Many parents and even some teachers still hesitate when health workers bring vaccines to schools. We need to create awareness so that caregivers understand the importance of vaccines, especially for children under 5,"" Kasichana said.

Sub-county Immunisation Coordinator John Karisa urged parents to take advantage of the 23 health facilities in Malindi that offer routine vaccines, from BCG at birth to HPV for girls aged 10-14 years.

""By July [2025], our coverage was at just 35% against a target of 90% by December [2025]. We call on all stakeholders and parents to take responsibility because health is a shared duty,"" Karisa said.

Religious leaders have also thrown their weight behind the campaign.

Famau Mohammed Famau, a Malindi cleric, dismissed myths and misconceptions about vaccines, urging parents to act responsibly.

""There is no harm in taking children for vaccination. Religious leaders strongly oppose false beliefs that discourage immunisation. Parents must take full responsibility and protect their children,"" he said.

Health officials are now banking on continued community sensitisation and stakeholder involvement to reverse the poor performance and shield Malindi residents from preventable disease outbreaks.

DHS: 5 new cases of measles linked to Oconto County outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------
Fourteen people in northeast Wisconsin have been infected with measles, state health officials said Friday [22 Aug 2025]. 

The Department of Health Services first reported 9 cases of measles in Oconto County in early August [2025]. All 5 of the newly reported cases are linked to that outbreak.

Officials said ages of the infected range from 7 months to 53 years old. Most are unvaccinated.

Stephanie Schauer, the state's immunization program director, said one dose of measles vaccine is 93% effective at preventing infection, and the recommended 2-dose course is 97% effective. In the absence of vaccines, she said, measles is ""one of the most highly infectious diseases that we have.""

""If someone is in an indoor space with measles and leaves, the virus remains suspended in the air for up to 2 hours,"" Schauer said -- meaning it can infect someone who comes into contact with the virus even without face-to-face contact with an infected person.

There have not been hospitalizations or deaths linked to the outbreak in northeast Wisconsin, officials said.

Schauer said nationally, about 92% of new measles cases are in those who are unvaccinated.

The confirmation of new spread of the disease comes days after state health officials announced possible measles exposures at 2 Wisconsin truck stops. In that case, an out-of-state traveler who was infected with measles was at the Flying J Travel Center on 70th Avenue in the St. Croix village of Roberts on 4 Aug 2025 between 7:15 and 10 a.m., and at the Pilot Travel Center on Milwaukee Road in Beloit on the same day between 11:45 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.

Measles is a potentially deadly respiratory illness, especially for the very young or old and those with weakened immune systems. Symptoms typically appear 10 to 21 days after exposure. They include a runny nose, high fever, tiredness, cough, red and watery eyes, a red rash and raised bumps that start at the hairline and move to the arms and legs.

People can check their own immunization records with the state or their provider. Wisconsin also offers programs to help uninsured children and adults receive vaccines at no cost.

Wisconsin has one of the lowest measles vaccination rates among children in the country. As of 2023, 81% of 2-year-olds had the vaccine, down from 88% in 2013. Some Wisconsin counties had vaccination rates closer to 50%.

Lyon's Hepatitis A Outbreak Impacts 73 People
---------------------------------------------
Since 2016, there has been an increase in the number of hepatitis A cases, primarily affecting men in low-endemic countries across Europe.

According to a recent report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Austria, Czechia, Hungary, and Slovakia reported higher-than-expected numbers of hepatitis A virus (HAV) subgenotype IB cases in 2025.

Additionally, France recently reported HAV cases, with 73 reported in the Rhône department as of 19 Aug 2025.

This French health ministry HAV data marks a 356% increase in cases compared to the same period in 2024.

The Rhône department is located in the east-central administrative region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, which includes the Lyon Metropolis, and has a population of approximately 1 875 747.

Previous HAV outbreaks in France, particularly in the Seine-Maritime department, are reported by the ECDC.

Since HepA is a vaccine-preventable disease, the U.S. CDC recommends hepatitis A vaccination for most international travelers engaging in higher-risk activities, such as visiting smaller cities, villages, or rural areas where they may be exposed to food or water contamination.

And for travelers who plan on eating street food in France.

In the United States, HepA vaccines are generally offered at travel pharmacies and clinics in 2025.

People at risk include those who have not been fully vaccinated or have not had measles in the past.

There have been 7 reported cases of measles so far in 2025 [in New Jersey], according to the CDC.

The person presented with measles following close contact with an out-of-state resident who also had a confirmed case of measles, the New Jersey Health Department said. This case is unrelated to previously reported cases of measles in the state, the department said.

The state is not experiencing a measles outbreak, which is defined as 3 or more related cases by the CDC.

Symptoms of measles include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery red eyes, and a red rash that begins at the hair, according to the CDC.

People can spread measles to others from 4 days before through 4 days after the rash appears. Anyone who suspects an exposure is urged to call their local health department or a health-care provider before going to any medical office or emergency department.

Of the cases reported in the USA for 2025, 97% are among people who had not received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine or have unknown vaccination status, according to the state Department of Health.

Outbreak in Sumenep: Recognizing the Difference Between Measles and German Measles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The continued spread of measles cases in Sumenep, East Java, has prompted the government to declare an extraordinary event (KLB). From January to August 2025, there have been more than 2000 measles cases, resulting in 17 child deaths. 

The spread of measles cases is believed to be partly due to the large number of children who missed out on immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The Posyandu (Integrated Health Post) services, which are usually routine, were temporarily suspended, resulting in many children missing their scheduled vaccinations.
 
""In fact, at the age of 9 months, they should and are required to receive the measles vaccine,"" said the Regent of Sumenep, Achmad Fauzi Wongsojudo, reported by Kompas.com [23 Aug 2025]. 

This condition is a reminder of the importance of immunization, especially MR (Measles and Rubella) immunization, to protect children from 2 diseases that are often considered similar, namely measles and German measles. 

People often confuse measles with rubella, but they are different and have different health impacts. 

The difference between measles and German measles 
--------------------------------------------------
According to Dr. Santi, Health Management Specialist Corporate, measles is an infectious disease caused by the morbillivirus.

It spreads rapidly through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or even talks or breathes. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and reddish patches on the skin. If left untreated, measles can cause serious complications, ranging from diarrhea, pneumonia, encephalitis, to blindness and death. 

""Measles is a highly contagious disease. Around 90% of people who have never had measles or have never received the measles vaccine will contract measles when they are around someone who has measles,"" explained Dr. Santi.

Meanwhile, German measles, or rubella, tends to be milder. Symptoms are similar, including fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and joint pain. However, this disease is very dangerous if it affects pregnant women, especially in the 1st trimester. Rubella infection can cause miscarriage or birth defects such as heart defects, brain damage, vision problems, and hearing loss. Both are airborne, but their effects differ. Measles can be fatal for children, while rubella poses significant risks to pregnancy. 

MR immunization as protection
-----------------------------
The only effective way to prevent measles and rubella is with the MR vaccine. This vaccine is given to children aged 9 months to under 15 years in a mass campaign program, then added to the routine immunization schedule. 

""The MR vaccine is safe to use and has been used in more than 141 countries, and has received recommendations from the WHO and distribution permits from the BPOM,"" said Dr. Santi. Through MR immunization, children's bodies form antibodies that protect them from 2 diseases at once.

В понедельник, 25 августа, власти Индонезии развернули кампанию по вакцинации от кори в ответ на вспышку заболевания, которая привела к 17 смертельным случаям. Об этом пишет Associated Press.
По данным официальных лиц, за последние восемь месяцев в провинции Восточная Ява было инфицировано более 2 тыс. детей, 16 из 17 смертей произошли в Суменепе. По данным районного агентства здравоохранения округа, шестнадцать пациентов не были иммунизированы, а один не прошел полную вакцинацию.
«Индонезия уже сообщала о вспышках этого высокоинфекционного заболевания, которые в основном были вызваны недостаточным охватом вакцинации», — говорится в материале.
По данным Статистического управления Индонезии, в прошлом году лишь 72 % из 22 миллионов детей в возрасте до 5 лет в Индонезии получили прививку от кори, а в некоторых провинциях уровень вакцинации был ниже 50 %.

A vaccination campaign and mandatory vaccination for school attendance have been implemented in the most affected state.

Según el último informe epidemiológico, el brote se ha extendido a 21 estados y 89 municipios del país. Chihuahua concentra la mayoría de los casos con 3,872 contagios, seguido de Sonora (87), Coahuila (51), Guerrero (31), Durango (22), Zacatecas (21), Michoacán (14), Sinaloa y Campeche (13 cada uno) y Tamaulipas (12).

Los grupos más afectados son los niños de 0 a 4 años, jóvenes de 25 a 29 años y adultos de 30 a 34 años.

El secretario de Salud, David Kershenobich Stalnikowitz, señaló a finales de julio que la propagación se mantiene “bastante contenida”, concentrándose principalmente en Chihuahua. En ese estado, se implementó la Estrategia Escudo Juárez, que contempla:

Campaña masiva de vacunación gratuita para personas de 6 meses a 49 años.

Exigir la vacuna como requisito obligatorio para el regreso a clases en todos los niveles educativos.

Aunque no existe un tratamiento específico, la mayoría de los pacientes se recupera en 2 a 3 semanas. No obstante, el sarampión puede causar complicaciones graves, como neumonía, diarrea intensa, encefalitis, infecciones de oído e incluso ceguera, especialmente en niños desnutridos o personas con sistemas inmunológicos debilitados.

Earlier this month [August 2025], 27-year-old Vejalpur [a locality in Ahmadabad district in Gujarat state] resident [ML] had to be hospitalised after bouts of severe fever and diarrhoea. Doctors diagnosed her with hepatitis A. After 2 days in ICU due to her severe condition, she was kept under observation for 4 more days before discharge. Such was the severity that [ML] couldn't even take a sip of water for a couple of days, and would pass out from dehydration, said treating doctors.

""It has been a fortnight now. Doctors have advised her to continue drinking boiled water and avoid oily and spicy food for another week. She still fights fatigue,"" said a family member, adding, ""A couple of other people in our colony, too, reported the infection.""

With monsoon's vigorous return, experts in the city say that cases of hepatitis A have seen a spike. In July [2025], the Civil Hospital recorded 237 cases at a daily average of 8. The number rose to about 11 cases daily in August [2025], with 224 recorded till 21 Aug 2025, said authorities. At private hospitals, too, OPD treatments and hospitalisations have increased.

Dr Bhavin Vasavada, HPB and liver transplant surgeon at Shalby Hospital, said that monsoon is usually the season for hepatitis A proliferation.

""In some severe cases, it leads to jaundice, which takes about 2 months for full recovery. The majority are self-limited, but should not be taken lightly,"" he said.

Dr Pathik Parikh, hepatologist at Apollo Hospital, said that this month [August 2025] they saw about 6 patients who needed ventilator support due to aggravated conditions.

""After a couple of days of onset, the patients report symptoms of jaundice and, in some cases, disorientation,"" he said.

Experts said that the primary reason is contaminated water or outside food. In several cases, use of unhygienically made or stored ice, too, can be the reason.

""Timely intervention can provide better results. Due to the season of infections, one cannot ascertain the cause just by fever. Fever might have several different reasons,"" said Dr Dhiren Mehta, a city-based general physician and president of Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA).

Norwegian hepatitis A outbreak sickens 38; restaurant reopens
-----------------------------------------------------
The restaurant linked to a hepatitis A outbreak in Norway has reopened. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) said there are 38 patients with probable connection to the outbreak, of which 27 have been confirmed by genomic sequencing. Patients were tested between 10 Jul and 14 Aug 2025. [Of the 38 patients], 25 live in Oslo, 11 in Akershus, and 1 each in Vestland and Innlandet.

For patients with available information, cases are aged between 16 and 84. They have an identical genotype IA strain. One case was a food handler at the restaurant.

The outbreak was initially managed by the Oslo municipality and Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Mattilsynet) with assistance from FHI. However, when patients were reported from across the country, FHI took over coordination of the incident. Officials with the Norwegian Food Safety Authority are interviewing patients to try and find the source of infection.

Frognerseteren café and restaurant in Oslo said all employees have been vaccinated and the site had undergone infection control measures including disinfection of the premises. The outlet has also reinforced food safety routines and rectified issues found by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority. Frognerseteren decided to close on 2 Aug [2025] and reopened its doors on 14 Aug [2025].

Stig Furuseth, restaurant owner, said it had been a demanding time, but the period was used to ensure eating at Frognerseteren was even safer than before.

""When something like this happens, we just have to deal with it. We have learned a lot along the way in connection with this case. It has been crucial for us to now be able to open again with complete security.""

Hepatitis A is a virus that can cause a liver infection. Symptoms can last a few days to several months. Most people who are infected recover completely and develop lifetime immunity. Symptoms can begin 15 to 50 days after becoming infected. They range from mild to severe and include an abrupt onset of fever, fatigue, poor appetite, nausea, stomach pain, dark-colored urine, and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes).

VCH warns of possible hepatitis A exposure at Gibsons location
--------------------------------------------------------------

Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) is notifying people who dined at the Sea Monkey Coffee food truck at Sunday Cider between August 1 and 25 [2025] that they may have been exposed to hepatitis A. Sunday Cider is located just west of Gibsons, off of Highway 101, on the Sunshine Coast.

The notification, issued Thursday afternoon [28 Aug 2025], does not include customers of other businesses at 1632 Sunshine Coast Highway, including the cidery itself. It also does not include people who dined at the food truck outside of these dates or who consumed only drinks at the venue.

VCH recommends anyone who dined at the food truck between August 14 and 25 [2025] receive a hepatitis A vaccine, which can help prevent infection if given within 2 weeks of the exposure. A free vaccine dose is available for those eligible at clinics and pharmacies.

VCH says the risk of transmission to the public is low, but does advise anyone who consumed food from Sea Monkey to monitor themselves for symptoms of the virus. Symptoms include feeling very tired; feeling sick to your stomach and not feeling hungry; losing weight without trying; pain on the right side of the belly, under the rib cage (where your liver is); fever; sore muscles; yellow skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and clay-colored stools. Symptoms of the liver disease can take 2 to 7 weeks to develop and last for about 2 months.

If someone has symptoms of hepatitis A, they should see their health care provider. ""In most cases, the infection goes away on its own and does not lead to long-term liver problems. In rare cases, it can be more serious,"" said the notification.

Those previously infected with hepatitis A or who were vaccinated with two doses before exposure are considered protected.

770 measles cases detected in Israel in past 3 months, says Health Ministry
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Health Ministry reports that 770 people in Israel have been diagnosed with measles over the past 3 months, of whom 228 are active patients and 24 of whom are hospitalized -- 2 in intensive care. Most of those hospitalized are children who were not vaccinated against the disease. Two toddlers without underlying diseases who were not vaccinated against the disease died of measles in mid-August 2025.

The ministry also says that a measles patient traveled by public transportation during the contagious period of the disease. On 25 Aug 2025, the patient took bus line 465 from Emmanuel to Jerusalem at 11:30 a.m. and later took bus lines 65 and 39 within Jerusalem, before taking the 465 back to Emmanuel at midnight.

Since this is a highly contagious disease, the ministry asks individuals who may have come in contact with the patient to ensure they are vaccinated in accordance with recommendations. Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that manifests itself in fever, general malaise, runny nose and rash, and can have serious and even life-threatening complications.

<https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/817213-despite-progress-polio-variant-lingers-in-nigerias-north-west-official.html>


A vaccine-derived strain of the poliovirus is still circulating in parts of Nigeria's North West, raising concern that the country's hard-won progress against the disease could be undermined.

The Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya, raised the concern on Thursday [28 Aug 2025] while briefing journalists after the National Economic Council (NEC) meeting presided over by Vice President Kashim Shettima.

Mr Yahaya recalled that the National Committee on Polio Eradication, inaugurated in December 2023, has been holding regular sessions to assess progress and refine strategies.

He stressed that while Nigeria was declared free of wild poliovirus in 2020, the challenge now is the variant strain spreading across Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara states.

Decline in reported cases
-------------------------
Polio, short for poliomyelitis, is a highly infectious viral disease that spreads mainly through contaminated food, water, or contact with an infected person.

While most infections show mild or no symptoms, the virus can, in severe cases, invade the nervous system and cause permanent paralysis, particularly in children under 5.

Nigeria was certified free of wild poliovirus in 2020, but outbreaks of a vaccine-derived variant remain a major concern in communities with low immunisation coverage.

Mr Yahaya disclosed that Nigeria recorded 78 cases of the variant in epidemiological week 33 of 2024, a figure that has since dropped to 42.

""As of the 33rd epidemiological week in 2024, Nigeria recorded 78 cases. That figure has now dropped to 42, showing a clear downward trend,"" he said.

Kano and Katsina states recorded reductions of 65 and 84% respectively, while Gombe has reported no new cases this year [2025].

Sokoto, however, remains the epicentre, accounting for 13 of the 23 cases recorded nationwide so far in 2025.

Expanded surveillance and vaccination
-------------------------------------
According to Mr Yahaya, recent interventions have strengthened surveillance and immunisation efforts.

He explained that the use of geo-coordinate data has expanded the tracking of settlements, rising from 71% in April to 78% in June [2025], while vaccination coverage improved from 81 to 84% in the same period.

He noted that the 1st round of targeted activities across 11 high-risk states reached 77% of intended settlements, with about 2.7 million children vaccinated, representing 83% coverage.

Beyond vaccination, he noted that integrated services were also provided.

Pregnant women received nutritional supplements, households were given malaria prevention kits, and communities accessed other maternal and child health interventions.

This approach, he said, was designed to enhance acceptance and trust in the campaigns.

Upcoming immunisation rounds
----------------------------
Mr Yahaya announced that the 2nd round of immunisation will run from 11 to 14 Sep 2025 across the 11 high-risk states.

He added that a nationwide campaign will follow in October [2025], targeting children aged 0-14 years with a package that includes measles, rubella, polio and malaria vaccines, alongside treatments for neglected tropical diseases.

The campaign will be rolled out in 2 phases to maximise coverage.

Roles for state and local officials
-----------------------------------
To ensure effective delivery, the national committee directed deputy governors to personally chair state task force meetings at least 2 weeks before each campaign round, especially in Kano, Kebbi and Sokoto.

Commissioners for Health and heads of primary healthcare agencies are to lead post-campaign reviews and mop-up operations, while local government chairmen will oversee grassroots mobilisation.

Mr Yahaya also urged security agencies to protect health workers operating in volatile areas, noting that vaccination teams are often at risk in hard-to-reach communities.

He further revealed that the committee has asked the Accountant General of the Federation to expedite disbursements for primary healthcare, warning that delayed funding could undermine the campaign.

Mr Yahaya cautioned that Nigeria's northern borders remain a weak point in the eradication effort.

Peak medical body urges vaccinations as whooping cough reaches highest outbreak levels since 1991
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Australia's peak medical body has sounded the alarm as cases of whooping cough reach an almost 3-decade peak. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) issued a warning on Saturday [30 Aug 2025], labeling the current outbreak of the respiratory virus, known as pertussis, as ""extremely concerning"".

""We can't afford to be complacent,"" AMA President Dr Danielle McMullen said. ""Each year, thousands of lives are lost to respiratory diseases like whooping cough -- and we all have a role to play in preventing their spread. Vaccination remains our most powerful defense.""

According to the AMA, more than 57 000 cases of whooping cough were reported to health authorities in 2024 -- the highest annual total since 1991 -- with the outbreak being considered Australia's most significant in decades. According to the Australian Government's National Communicable Disease Surveillance Dashboard, there has been almost 19 000 cases reported so far in 2025. There are particularly high rates of infection in Queensland, Western Australia's Kimberly region and South Australia.

Caused by infection with the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_, whooping cough is known for severe and uncontrollable coughing fits. The AMA is calling on pregnant women, parents, and caregivers to access vaccines for the disease, noting it can be life-threatening for newborns and young children.

Dr. McMullen said outbreak of whooping cough was concerning, given below-target rates of vaccination. ""Getting vaccinated is one of the simplest and most effective ways you can protect your loved ones and your community,"" she said. ""We must not lose sight of the fact that immunisation saves lives.""

Introduction
-------------
_Bordetella pertussis_ (Bp) is the causative agent of pertussis (whooping cough), a widespread and highly contagious respiratory infection. Although the bacterium can infect individuals of all ages, infants are particularly vulnerable to severe manifestations of the disease, which can occasionally be fatal [1]. Pertussis exhibits a well-documented seasonal pattern, with case numbers typically increasing during the spring and summer months [2]. Pertussis can be prevented by vaccination, and Tuscany follows the National Immunisation Plan of Italy, recommending pertussis vaccination at 3, 5, and 11â€¯months, with boosters at 6â€¯years, 12-18â€¯years, and every 10â€¯years thereafter alongside diphtheria and tetanus.

Tuscany region has a high coverage rate for pertussis vaccination. In 2023, 97.7% of 2-year-olds were vaccinated, more than the Italian national average of 94.8%, and at 16â€¯years of age, coverage was 75.8% compared with 68.4% nationally [3]. Nonetheless, even in regions where vaccination coverage is high, _B. pertussis_ continues to circulate, and outbreaks may still occur [4-6].

The essential role of adherence to the vaccination program in preventing severe disease and reducing transmission is well recognized. Communication campaigns aiming at motivating healthcare professionals and caregivers, and at improving vaccine acceptance, have been pivotal. Over recent decades, several initiatives have been undertaken to increase vaccination coverage, such as the distribution of information toolkits to families by primary care physicians or paediatricians and targeted vaccination awareness campaigns within specific communities [7-10]. However, while the overall vaccination status according to the immunization schedule is often monitored, the importance of being vaccinated promptly, on the earliest eligible day, is probably underestimated. Many public health interventions do not specifically emphasise the urgency of early immunisation.

We aimed to investigate, in a region with high pertussis vaccination coverage, adherence to the recommended vaccination schedule and the time interval, if any, between the earliest eligible date for vaccine administration and the date of hospitalization for pertussis.

Methods and definitions
--------------------
Vaccination programme against pertussis in Tuscany:

The vaccination program in Tuscany includes 3 doses of hexavalent (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP)-polio-_Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib)-hepatitis B (HBV)) vaccine at 3, 5, and 11-12â€¯months of age, followed by a booster dose atâ€¯6â€¯years and a booster dose at 12-18â€¯years with a quadrivalent vaccine (DTP-polio). Thereafter, a booster is recommended every 10â€¯years, in combination with diphtheria and tetanus vaccinations. All vaccinations included in the program are provided free of charge.

A child is considered formally compliant for the first dose at the age of 1-2â€¯months, regardless of whether the dose has yet been administered. Compliance for the second dose is defined as being within the eligible time frame for that dose (the fifth month of life), even if the vaccine has not yet been received. Similar criteria were applied for subsequent doses. For instance, an adolescent aged 12-16â€¯years is defined as formally compliant if all previous doses have been administered, even if the adolescent booster, scheduled at 12-18â€¯years, has not yet been received.

Study design and case definitions:

We conducted a retrospective observational study of all pertussis-related hospitalizations from 2016 to 2024 in a tertiary university hospital in Tuscany (Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]).

We defined a pertussis case as a patient aged â‰¤â€‰16â€¯years and admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of pertussis, subsequently confirmed by detection of the bacterium from an anterior nasal or oropharyngeal swab with real-time PCR, in accordance with recommendations of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), as previously described [11,12]. Before 2021, we used primers, probes, and procedure described by ECDC [11]. Since 2021, the Allplex Respiratory Panel 4 (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) has also been used. All testing was performed in the Laboratory of Immunology, Microbiology and Molecular Surveillance of the Meyer Children's Hospital IRCCS in Florence, where PCR-based surveillance of all paediatric respiratory infections in Tuscany is routinely conducted. Patients negatively tested for _B. pertussis_ were excluded from the study. Each patient was included only once in the study. The Meyer hospital has annually approximately 8800 inpatient discharges, 33 700 day hospital visits, 40 000 emergency department visits, and 867 000 outpatient services.

Vaccination status:

Vaccination status was retrieved from the unified digital vaccination registry of Tuscany region, which is updated daily by family paediatricians and vaccination centres. For each patient, the time interval between the first eligible day for vaccine administration (when the vaccine could have been given but was not) and the onset of disease was calculated. Thus, the delay was defined as the number of days between the first eligible vaccination date and disease onset. At the time of admission, maternal pertussis vaccination status was also recorded for children agedâ€‰ <â€‰3â€¯months.

Statistical analysis:

Descriptive statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 21 (<https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics>). Continuous variables were expressed as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR), and categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages.

Results
------
Descriptive analysis of pertussis patients:

From January 2016 to December 2024, 384 children and adolescents aged â‰¤â€¯16â€¯years with laboratory-confirmed pertussis were hospitalised at Meyer Children's Hospital. The age distribution is shown in Figure 2. From 2016 to 2023, the median age of the cases was 1.6â€¯years (IQR: 0.2-7.1â€¯years; mean: 4.0â€¯years). During this period, 58 (46.4%) of 125 cases were infants (aged â‰¤â€¯1â€¯year). In 2024, a rapid increase in pertussis-related hospitalizations was observed, starting in January, peaking in March and April, and declining to no hospitalizations by November (Figure 3).

Compared with 2016-2019, there was a ninefold increase in admissions in 2024, rising from a mean of 28.2 to 259 cases per year. Notably, 51.7% of the 259 cases in 2024 were adolescents (aged 10-16â€¯years). The median age of the cases increased from 1.6â€¯years in 2016-2023 to 11.1â€¯years in 2024 (IQR: 7.8-13.0â€¯years; mean: 9.8â€¯years). In 2024, most (136/259, 52.5%) cases were aged 10-14â€¯years, while only 7.3% (19/259) were infants.

Vaccination status of pertussis cases:

Vaccination data were available for 368 (95.8%) of 384 cases. Among the 77 cases aged <â€¯1â€¯year, 20 (26.0%) were aged <â€¯2â€¯months and therefore too young to be vaccinated. None of their mothers had received the recommended pertussis vaccination during pregnancy, despite it being offered free of charge. Of the 57 infants eligible for vaccination, 29 had not received any dose. The mean delay between the first eligible vaccination date and hospitalization was 78â€¯days (median: 31â€¯days; IQR: 10-131â€¯days). Eleven infants had received one dose and were eligible for the second but had not yet received it; in this group, the mean delay was 61â€¯days (median: 44â€¯days; IQR: 22-70â€¯days). Three infants had received 2 doses and were eligible for the third but had not yet received it, with a mean delay of 46â€¯days (median: 53â€¯days). Fourteen infants had received all doses for which they were eligible.

Vaccination status was not documented for 16 (5.2%) of 307 cases aged >â€¯1â€¯year. Among the remaining 291, vaccination was not compliant with the recommended schedule for 67 cases (23.0%): 51 (17.5%) were unvaccinated, 4 (1.4%) had received one dose, and 12 (4.1%) had not the full vaccination for their age (third dose or booster).

Of the 178 adolescent cases, 71 (39.9%) were aged 10-12â€¯years and received the booster at 6â€¯years but were below the recommended adolescent booster (fifth dose) age of 12-18â€¯years. Of the 107 cases aged 12-16â€¯years, vaccination status could not be confirmed for 9 (8.4%), 5 (5.1%) were unvaccinated, 88 (89.8%) had received 4 doses, and 5 (5.1%) had received 5 doses. Among the 88 who had received 4 doses and were eligible for 5 doses, the mean of the time gap between the first eligible day for vaccination and disease onset was 542â€¯days (median: 395â€¯days; IQR: 236-717â€¯days).

Vaccination status during the 2024 outbreak is summarised in Figure 4. Data indicate that although most adolescents appeared to be formally compliant (within the scheduled window of 12-18â€¯years), 95% had not yet received the adolescent booster at the time of the hospitalisation.

Age and duration of hospitalization:

The reason for hospitalization was persistent cough or lower respiratory airways disease. Of the 384 cases, 150 (39.1%) were hospitalized for <â€¯24â€¯h and discharged after laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis. All cases received antimicrobial treatment, either azithromycin or clarithromycin. The duration of hospitalization and the proportion of patients requiring high-intensity care is shown in Figure 5.

Discussion
---------
Following a period from mid-2020, coinciding with the implementation of social distancing measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, until the end of 2023 during which no cases were recorded, a marked and rapid increase in pertussis cases was observed at the beginning of 2024, mirroring observations in other countries [4-6]. As also reported in several European countries, such as Denmark, Spain, and France, the 2024 outbreak in Tuscany affected adolescents, while the proportion of cases in infants was lower compared with previous outbreaks [13-15].

Most adolescent cases had been appropriately vaccinated in early childhood in accordance with the Italian immunization schedule, suggesting that waning immunity -- rather than vaccine refusal -- was the principal determinant of pertussis in this age group. In our study, the cases were seldom vaccinated during the earliest days they were eligible for vaccination. The median interval between the first eligible vaccination date and the onset of pertussis was 31â€¯days for the first dose, 44â€¯days for the second, and 53â€¯days for the third. However, our data suggest that in most hospitalized pertussis cases, vaccination had not been administered at the earliest time points. It is likely that timely vaccination could have prevented hospitalization in many of these cases. Among adolescents, the average time between the first eligible date for the booster (fifth dose) and the onset of disease exceeded oneâ€¯year. According to the current Italian vaccination schedule, the adolescent booster can be given at the age of 12-18â€¯years. However, we consider this a missed opportunity for protection as 93 of our 98 cases aged 12-16â€¯years had not received the booster at the time of hospitalisation.

We do not know how common delaying vaccination is and what the reasons are. Shortening this interval and recommending timely administration shortly after the 12th birthday could reduce hospitalizations. A similar interpretation can be drawn from data on younger children. In Tuscany, as in other European countries, childhood vaccination coverage within the first 2â€¯years of life is high. The importance of this study is to examine not only whether vaccinations were administered, but also whether they were administered at the earliest possible time within the recommended schedule.

Contrary to our findings, an eightfold increase in pertussis cases among children aged <â€¯2â€¯years was seen in the 2024 outbreak in southern Italy [16]. Our data align more closely with the observations in other European countries [13-15], with a significant rise in cases among adolescents, particularly those aged 10-16â€¯years during 2024 compared with the pre-pandemic period. Only a modest increase in cases among infants was observed, with 19 cases recorded in 2024 vs an annual average of 14 pre-pandemic. The proportion of cases in children aged <â€¯2â€¯years dropped sharply, from 50% in the pre-pandemic years to 4.9% in 2024.

Our findings also confirm earlier studies that identified age and vaccination status as key factors in determining disease severity [17-20]. Notably, infants required longer hospital stays, which may be considered a proxy indicator of severity.

A limitation of this study is that we could not correlate the type of vaccine received with the risk of hospitalization. Over the study period, different hexavalent and quadrivalent (DTP-polio) vaccines were used due to frequent changes in procurement tenders. Consequently, it was not possible to determine whether the number of vaccine components (2, 3, or 5) influenced outcomes.

Vaccination coverage in Italy varies by region, and Tuscany has one of the highest coverage rates for pertussis vaccination in infants and adolescents [3]. While coverage of childhood vaccinations is generally measured at 2â€¯years of age, this metric does not capture delays in dose administration within the recommended programme. Our findings indicate that even in children and adolescents formally considered up to date with their immunisations, earlier administration could have prevented hospitalisation. A public health campaign aimed at both families and healthcare professionals, stressing not only the importance of vaccination but also the importance of timely administration, could help further reduce disease incidence and associated hospitalisations.

During the 2024 outbreak, the highest number of cases were seen among those aged 10-14â€¯years. Among adolescents aged >â€¯12â€¯years, the vast majority had not yet received the second booster, despite eligibility from the age of 12â€¯years onwards. These findings suggest 2 potential strategies to enhance immunisation coverage: firstly, to promote earlier administration of the fifth dose (adolescent booster), which is currently scheduled from 12 to 18â€¯years of age; and secondly, to reduce the wide time frame (currently spanning 6â€¯years) for this dose. One possible approach could be to recommend administration at 10-11â€¯years of age.

Robust, year-round surveillance of all hospitalised cases is critical to identifying emerging signals such as those documented in the 2024 outbreak. Such data-driven approaches are essential to refine and adapt prevention strategies in a timely manner.

Conclusions
---------
To mitigate the resurgence of pertussis and prevent future outbreaks, a combination of measures should be adopted. These include strict adherence to the immunization schedule, prioritising administration of vaccines at the earliest eligible opportunity, and consideration of advancing the adolescent booster dose. Strengthened surveillance systems are also essential to ensure timely adjustments to prevention strategies based on real-time epidemiological data.

PAHO calls for strengthened vaccination and surveillance amid the spread of antimicrobial-resistant pertussis in the Americas
----------------------------------------
In light of the resurgence of pertussis across several countries in the region and the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant strains, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reiterated the importance of strengthening vaccination and surveillance systems. The concern was shared during a recent meeting with the Latin American and Caribbean Network for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (ReLAVRA+), where the latest findings and response strategies to this highly contagious disease were discussed.

""Vaccination, surveillance, and the responsible use of antibiotics are critical to preventing pertussis from becoming a serious public health threat again,"" said Pilar RamÃ³n-Pardo, head of PAHO's Special Program on Antimicrobial Resistance. ""We still have time to contain this issue, but we must act now: increase vaccination coverage, strengthen early detection, and enhance our outbreak response capacity,"" she added.

One of the main challenges is that standard treatment relies on macrolide [antibacterials], such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin. However, genetic mutations in _Bordetella pertussis_, particularly in the 23S rRNA gene, are reducing the effectiveness of these drugs, complicating treatment for patients and prevention among close contacts.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the widespread and inappropriate use of [antimicrobials] like azithromycin may have contributed to the emergence of resistant strains. Since 2024, cases have been reported in Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and the USA, detected thanks to strengthened surveillance and diagnostic systems, including molecular testing and standardized methods in reference laboratories. These advancements, supported by international partnerships, have been key to identifying and containing these cases.

Given the widespread use of these [antimicrobials] and high international mobility, there is a risk of broader spread if health responses are not reinforced. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria develop mechanisms to evade the effects of drugs, rendering them ineffective. In the case of pertussis, this can limit treatment options, hinder outbreak control, and increase the risk of severe complications, particularly in areas with low vaccination coverage.

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, can be prevented with 3 doses of the DPT vaccine in children under one year of age, with boosters during childhood and adolescence. However, in infected individuals -- especially infants -- it can lead to severe illness, with risks of complications or even death.

The disease has resurged in the Americas. While 4139 cases were reported in 2023, the number soared to 43 751 in 2024. In the first 7 months of 2025, 9 countries reported over 18 595 cases and 128 deaths. The resurgence is linked to declining vaccination rates and underscores the need for strengthened, standardized surveillance.

During the pandemic, regional coverage for the first (DTP1) and third (DTP3) doses of the vaccine dropped to historic lows of 87% and 81% in 2021, respectively. By 2023, a partial recovery was observed (90% and 88%), but these rates remain below the 95% recommended by PAHO, with significant disparities within countries. In addition to childhood vaccination, PAHO recommends vaccinating pregnant women -- especially during outbreaks -- and healthcare workers in contact with newborns.

Strengthening national reference laboratories with reliable, standardized diagnostic methods is essential for timely detection of resistance and guiding health authorities' responses. Collaborative initiatives like PAHO's ReLAVRA+ network and PAHO's Genomic Surveillance Regional Networks (PAHOGen), along with other strategic partnerships, have enabled standardized methodologies and expanded surveillance capacity in several countries in the region.

As part of its technical cooperation, PAHO organized a virtual ReLAVRA+ network seminar on 19 Aug [2025], bringing together national reference laboratories and microbiology experts from the region. During the event, specialists from Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru shared recent findings, methodologies for detecting resistant strains, and surveillance and response strategies.

Given this scenario, PAHO urges countries to bolster their diagnostic capacity, enhance technical training for health personnel, maintain or increase vaccination coverage, and establish active, standardized surveillance systems to enable a rapid and effective response to antimicrobial resistance.

British baby dies from whooping cough as vaccination rates fall
------------------------------------------------------
A baby in the UK has died from whooping cough, marking the first such death in the country this year [2025]. The infant's mother had not been vaccinated against the highly infectious disease, which affects the lungs and airways. This death occurred as vaccination rates among children and pregnant women in the UK have fallen to their lowest levels in 15 years.

Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be fatal for babies, who are at the highest risk of severe illness or death. The child, thought to be under the age of one, was taken ill and died between March and June this year [2025], according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which is responsible for protecting the public from infectious diseases and other threats. It follows the death of a child from measles at Alder Hey children's hospital in Liverpool last month [July 2025] and the deaths in 2024 of 11 children in England after an outbreak of whooping cough.

Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, the UKHSA deputy director, said: ""Sadly, with a further infant death in the second quarter of 2025, we are again reminded how severe whooping cough can be for very young babies. Our thoughts and condolences are with the family who have so tragically lost their baby.""

The agency warned last week that vaccination rates for primary schoolchildren were at the lowest levels for 15 years. Almost one in 5 children starting primary school this week in England are not fully protected from diseases including whooping cough, polio, tetanus, and diphtheria. This puts the UK well below the World Health Organization's 95% threshold for herd immunity for all childhood vaccines.

Only 83.7% of 5-year-olds have received both doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, while uptake of the 4-in-one preschool booster vaccine -- which protects against polio, whooping cough, tetanus, and diphtheria -- stood at 81.4% among 5-year-olds in England. From next year [2026], the NHS will begin vaccinating all babies against chickenpox, or varicella, by combining it with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in a new MMRV.

Vaccine rates among pregnant women for whooping cough reached a peak of 76% in 2016 but fell to 59% by March 2024. Since the deaths last year [2024], vaccination rates among mothers recovered to 73%, but are still below the peak.

""Ensuring women are vaccinated in pregnancy has never been more important,"" Amirthalingam said. ""Vaccination is the best defence against whooping cough, and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time, ideally between 20 and 32 weeks. This passes protection to their baby in the womb so that they are protected from birth.

""The recent increase in uptake of the whooping cough vaccine among pregnant women across the country shows that even more mothers are taking steps to protect their newborns. We want to ensure every expectant mother is offered the vaccine at the optimal time and understands that this vaccine is the best way to protect their baby during those crucial first weeks after birth.

""If you are pregnant and approaching 20 weeks, and haven't been offered the whooping cough vaccine, please speak to your GP or midwife today to find out how you can get your vaccine.""

Mexico City expands vaccination efforts amid measles outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------------

Mexico's Ministry of Health has set up a phone service to direct residents of Mexico City to vaccination sites, as the capital joins the list of regions affected by the country's ongoing measles outbreak. The measure was announced after local authorities confirmed 4 infections and reported more than 350 suspected cases in the city.

The toll nationwide has now reached over 4300 cases across 21 states, with Chihuahua at the center of the crisis. That state alone accounts for nearly all of the country's fatalities -- 14 of 15 -- and over 90% of confirmed patients, reports El País. While other regions such as Oaxaca have reported smaller clusters, the slow but steady appearance of new cases has kept health authorities on alert.

In a press release, the ministry is urging the public to call 079 to identify the nearest vaccination unit. The service is free, and immunization is available at all public health centers. Officials stressed that doses are sufficient to meet demand, part of an effort to avoid the shortages that have frustrated patients and doctors in recent years.

The vaccination drive is directed at children as young as 6 months, adolescents, and adults up to 49 years old who lack a full immunization record, as well as teachers, health workers, and people considered at greater risk of complications. Families are being asked to review children's records and complete pending schedules, particularly for children under 5 years old. If documentation is missing, health staff will provide new cards or vaccination certificates.

Specialists had anticipated that measles could reach Mexico City given its size and mobility levels. Mauricio Rodríguez, an epidemiologist, says that vaccination rates in large cities tend to be higher than in rural areas, which may limit transmission. He adds that the capital experienced a prison-related outbreak in 2020 that was followed by a significant immunization campaign, potentially leaving the population better prepared today.

To reinforce supplies, the federal government announced in June [2025] the purchase of nearly 27 million doses, with the majority aimed at adults and 3.5 million set aside for young children. Still, the country faces a vaccination gap. The WHO reported that over 340 000 children in Mexico missed all routine immunizations in 2024, a delay that cannot be resolved quickly.

The focus remains on Chihuahua, where the outbreak first emerged among seasonal workers in Mennonite farming communities. Authorities expanded eligibility beyond the standard age range to include adults up to 49 years old, responding to the risk faced by this mobile workforce. The PAHO estimated earlier this year [2025] that about 1.8 million people in the state required an additional dose to contain the spread.

Although the pace of infections has slowed compared to the first months of the year, continued reporting of isolated cases across states keeps the risk of resurgence alive. Experts warn that if sustained transmission continues, Mexico and the region could lose their measles-free certification, a designation granted in 2024. To preserve that status, the outbreak must be brought under control before it completes a year of continuous spread.

An outbreak of hepatitis is impacting the Guantanamo Border Brigade, specifically within the Eastern Battalion, where most soldiers are newly recruited teenagers. Reports reveal the severity of the situation that military authorities are attempting to conceal.

According to independent journalist Yosmany Mayeta Labrada, who shared details on his Facebook page, families of the young recruits are seeking information about their children's health. However, they only receive evasive and reassuring messages from military leadership, while the disease continues to spread unchecked.

Communications from the recruits themselves contradict the official narrative, indicating that the outbreak is proliferating within the unit without effective measures to curb the spread. This incident highlights the weak sanitary conditions in military units and the lack of transparency in managing emergencies that endanger dozens of adolescents sent for mandatory service.

The absence of official information exacerbates the families' anxiety as their children fall ill within facilities shrouded in secrecy. The regime refuses to publicly acknowledge the outbreak.

On 27 Aug 2025, the Ministry of Public Health (Minsap) confirmed a ""slight increase"" in hepatitis A cases nationwide. Hepatitis A is an acute viral disease affecting the liver, primarily transmitted through ingestion of contaminated water or food. Its spread is facilitated by poor hygiene practices and inadequate water supply and treatment.

Francisco Durán, national director of Hygiene and Epidemiology at Minsap, advised, ""Whenever possible, boil water and use chlorine tablets, which are occasionally available at pharmacies in our country, to treat the water before consuming it. Additionally, ensure that vegetables are thoroughly washed with chlorinated water.""

Papua New Guinea confirms first human case of polio in ongoing outbreak
----------------
The National Department of Health (NDoH), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, has confirmed the first human case of paralytic poliomyelitis (cVDPV2) in Papua New Guinea. The case involves a 4-year-old unvaccinated boy from Lae, Morobe Province, who developed acute flaccid paralysis.

This marks a pivotal moment in the country's polio response, confirming that the virus has transitioned from environmental detection to direct impact on children.

To combat the spread, Papua New Guinea launched a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) on 11 Aug 2025, targeting children under 10 years with the novel oral polio vaccine (nOPV2). The campaign has been extended to 5 Sep [2025] to help provinces reach the critical 95% coverage target. As of 26 Aug [2025], national coverage stands at 41.2%, with Hela Province leading at 91%.

A second round of SIA is scheduled from 29 Sep to 17 Oct [2025], which will include both nOPV2 and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to provide stronger and longer-lasting protection. Over 9 million doses of nOPV2 and 4 million doses of IPV have been secured, along with additional stocks of measles-rubella, pentavalent vaccines, vitamin A, and deworming tablets.

Routine immunization is being integrated into both SIA rounds, especially for children under 2 years. Through the periodic intensification of routine immunization (PIRI), provinces are encouraged to boost coverage and build long-term community resilience. While uptake varies across regions, targeted efforts are underway to strengthen budget utilization and enhance service delivery, ensuring broader protection for children.

WHO and partners are leveraging digital tools like mSupply and ODK to track vaccine stocks and accountability. Community engagement is also a priority, with outreach through churches, schools, youth groups, and local leaders to ensure no child is left behind.

To date, 122 cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have been reported, with 93 tested and confirmed negative for cVDPV2 -- an important indicator of active surveillance. Efforts are being intensified to strengthen surveillance systems nationwide, with targeted support for provinces that have yet to report cases.

The National Department of Health, with support from WHO and partners, is working to improve stool sample adequacy -- currently at 62.5% -- through enhanced training, logistics, and active case finding. These measures are vital to ensuring timely detection and response, and to interrupting poliovirus transmission across all communities.

""Polio is preventable. The vaccines are safe, effective, and free,"" said Dr. Sevil Huseynova, WHO Representative in PNG. ""But we must act together -- with urgency and unity. WHO stands ready to support every province, every health worker, and every community.""

Papua New Guinea's fight against polio continues with unwavering determination and robust collaboration across all levels of society. With strong leadership, active community engagement, and steadfast international support, the country is working to interrupt transmission and protect every child -- moving closer to ending polio in PNG once and for all.

Wisconsin measles outbreak grows as Ohio reports family cluster
---------------------------------------------------------------
In Wisconsin, health officials in Oconto County have confirmed 9 more measles cases, raising the state's outbreak total to 23. The outbreak in Oconto County, located in northeastern Wisconsin, began in early August 2025. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS) said in a 29 Aug 2025 update that 2 people have been hospitalized. 

""The ongoing investigation indicates that measles is spreading locally. At this time, the investigation has not identified locations in public settings for which a full list of exposed people cannot be obtained,"" the WDHS said. The state's measles dashboard reflects that all 23 of the confirmed case-patients are unvaccinated. The most affected group is children ages 5 to 17 years old (13 cases), followed by adults (7 cases). 

Elsewhere, the Zanesville-Muskingum County Health Department in Ohio on 30 Aug 2025 announced that it has identified 3 confirmed measles cases in children, all unvaccinated, the agency said in a Facebook post. All 3 are from the same family and are currently at home and are improving. Muskingum County, home to Zanesville, is located in east central Ohio.

Health officials said they are working with the family and hospital to identify and follow up on any exposures and contacts.

NET Health confirms adult case of measles in East Texas
-------------------------------------------------------
A case of adult measles has been confirmed in Rains County, according to the Northeast Texas Public Health District (NET Health).

A spokesperson for NET Health said they received confirmation of a travel-related positive case in an adult resident living in Rains County. The patient voluntarily self-isolated at their residence while contagious and has since recovered. 

Persons who have been fully vaccinated against measles with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine have a very low risk of contracting the disease,"" NET Health said in a statement released Tuesday [2 Sep 2025]. ""However, unvaccinated individuals remain at higher risk, as do those in some other groups...""

Those groups include the following demographics:
- Children too young to have received both doses of the MMR vaccine yet
- Anyone who have received only one dose of MMR
- Those with compromised immune systems

""Measles is a highly contagious viral illness that spreads when an infectious person coughs or sneezes,"" the statement said. ""Someone with measles can spread it to susceptible people for up to 4 days prior to the appearance of a rash and for up to 4 days after rash onset.""

Symptoms of measles can include a high fever, coughing and runny nose, white spots inside the mouth (koplik spots) and an appearance of a rash 3-5 days after symptoms begin. In some cases, measles can also cause illness leading to hospitalization or death.

NET Health advises East Texans to follow these steps to help prevent measles:
- If you believe you have spent time with someone who has measles and you are experiencing symptoms consistent with measles, please seek medical care as soon as possible. It is important to call your healthcare provider ahead of time so they can take steps to keep you from exposing other patients.
- Persons who have not been vaccinated or are unsure of their vaccination status are encouraged to contact their healthcare provider about receiving the MMR vaccine.
- Vaccination prior to exposure provides protection and can modify the course of disease.
